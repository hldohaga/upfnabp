  abstract = {To explore how a sample of rural Louisiana residents constructed accounts about worry and stress in relationship to their high blood pressure. Qualitative study combining critical social theories, African American studies, and critical discourse concepts. Study participants consisted of a convenience sample (N = 30) of African American women (n = 15) and men (n = 15) with high blood pressure. Over a 4-month period in 1999 a community-based population sample was interviewed twice. Field experiences in the community and the assistance of community consultants were critical to data analysis. Based on 60 interviews, 191 passages about worry and 58 passages about stress were analyzed using discourse analysis. Participants not only distinguished between worry and stress in their everyday lives, but they also highlighted how those concepts were interrelated. Participants' concerns about themselves as well as their children, kin, and community were emphasized in passages about worry. Stress was primarily associated with doing multiple tasks and confronting multiple prejudices in the workplace and surrounding community. Participants perceived worry and stress as important health-related concepts that affected their high blood pressure. Nursing strategies designed to address these concerns may better facilitate holistic health.},

  abstract = {The COVID‐19 pandemic is a public health crisis, having killed more than 514~000 US adults as of March 2, 2021. COVID‐19 mitigation strategies have unintended consequences on managing chronic conditions such as hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and health disparities in the United States. During the first wave of the pandemic in the United States, the combination of observed racial/ethnic inequities in COVID‐19 deaths and social unrest reinvigorated a national conversation about systemic racism in health care and society. The 4th Annual University of Utah Translational Hypertension Symposium gathered frontline clinicians, researchers, and leaders from diverse backgrounds to discuss the intersection of these 2 critical social and public health phenomena and to highlight preexisting disparities in hypertension treatment and control exacerbated by COVID‐19. The discussion underscored environmental and socioeconomic factors that are deeply embedded in US health care and research that impact inequities in hypertension. Structural racism plays a central role at both the health system and individual levels. At the same time, virtual healthcare platforms are being accelerated into widespread use by COVID‐19, which may widen the divide in healthcare access across levels of wealth, geography, and education. Blood pressure control rates are declining, especially among communities of color and those without health insurance or access to health care. Hypertension awareness, therapeutic lifestyle changes, and evidence‐based pharmacotherapy are essential. There is a need to improve the implementation of community‐based interventions and blood pressure self‐monitoring, which can help build patient trust and increase healthcare engagement.},

In this scenario, the use of communication technologies becomes appropriate for the monitoring of patients with AH. To preliminary verify the intervention approach and the effects of using an m-Health application on the health conditions of patients with AH for a future study, we conducted a non-randomized, controlled, non-blind trial (N = 39), comparing the use of a mobile health app (m-Health) with conventional AH monitoring over 3 months. During the study, we promoted health information workshops to engage patients from both intervention and control groups. Pre and post-intervention, we compared measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure; food frequency questionnaire; Appraisal of Self-Care Agency Scale; blood tests of hemogram, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, lipid profile, and glycemia. Improvements were identified in both groups due to the workshops, including the reduction in total and non-HDL cholesterol, healthier consumption of salads and sugary drinks, and increased self-care scores. Exclusively in the intervention group, which used the m-Health app, there was a change in systolic and diastolic pressure towards more adequate levels. In addition, the intervention group had improved levels of glucose and HDL cholesterol and reduced consumption of ultra-processed foods. In conclusion, the use of an m-Health app had positive effects on the health conditions of patients with AH under treatment within FHS, especially when combined with health information. On the context of FHS, the use of technology is encouraging supporting better health conditions.},

  abstract = {Background The benefits of blood pressure lowering treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease are well established. However, the extent to which these effects differ by baseline blood pressure, presence of comorbidities, or drug class is less clear. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify these differences. Method For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE for large-scale blood pressure lowering trials, published between Jan 1, 1966, and July 7, 2015, and we searched the medical literature to identify trials up to Nov 9, 2015. All randomised controlled trials of blood pressure lowering treatment were eligible for inclusion if they included a minimum of 1000 patient-years of follow-up in each study arm. No trials were excluded because of presence of baseline comorbidities, and trials of antihypertensive drugs for indications other than hypertension were eligible. We extracted summary-level data about study characteristics and the outcomes of major cardiovascular disease events, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. We used inverse variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool the estimates. Results We identified 123 studies with 613\hphantom{,}815 participants for the tabular meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses showed relative risk reductions proportional to the magnitude of the blood pressure reductions achieved. Every 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular disease events (relative risk [RR] 0·80, 95\% CI 0·77–0·83), coronary heart disease (0·83, 0·78–0·88), stroke (0·73, 0·68–0·77), and heart failure (0·72, 0·67–0·78), which, in the populations studied, led to a significant 13\% reduction in all-cause mortality (0·87, 0·84–0·91). However, the effect on renal failure was not significant (0·95, 0·84–1·07). Similar proportional risk reductions (per 10 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure) were noted in trials with higher mean baseline systolic blood pressure and trials with lower mean baseline systolic blood pressure (all ptrend{$>$}0·05). There was no clear evidence that proportional risk reductions in major cardiovascular disease differed by baseline disease history, except for diabetes and chronic kidney disease, for which smaller, but significant, risk reductions were detected. β blockers were inferior to other drugs for the prevention of major cardiovascular disease events, stroke, and renal failure. Calcium channel blockers were superior to other drugs for the prevention of stroke. For the prevention of heart failure, calcium channel blockers were inferior and diuretics were superior to other drug classes. Risk of bias was judged to be low for 113 trials and unclear for 10 trials. Heterogeneity for outcomes was low to moderate; the I2 statistic for heterogeneity for major cardiovascular disease events was 41\%, for coronary heart disease 25\%, for stroke 26\%, for heart failure 37\%, for renal failure 28\%, and for all-cause mortality 35\%. Interpretation Blood pressure lowering significantly reduces vascular risk across various baseline blood pressure levels and comorbidities. Our results provide strong support for lowering blood pressure to systolic blood pressures less than 130 mm Hg and providing blood pressure lowering treatment to individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.

  abstract = {Trends in hypertension prevalence are difficult to assess because of a massive increase in the prevalence of antihypertensive treatment. Over the past three decades mean blood pressure levels among the 5209 members of the Framingham Study cohort have declined, and elevated blood pressure is only one third as prevalent. However, if those receiving treatment who have normalized blood pressures are defined as hypertensive, in addition to those with elevated blood pressure, the prevalence of hypertension has increased. No consistent secular trend in the incidence of hypertension was noted over three decades, but high blood pressure eventually developed in two thirds of the study cohort. To determine whether untreated blood pressure levels are changing over time, trends in mean blood pressure were examined in normotensive subjects over three decades. Only a 1 mm Hg decline in mean systolic and diastolic pressure over each 10-year interval was noted (p {$<$} 0.001). Thus blood pressure in the normotensive segment of the population has been quite stable. Because the incidence of hypertension is very high and future hypertension arises from the upper end of the normal blood pressure distribution, there is an urgent need for primary prevention. Preventive measures such as exercise, avoidance of salt and alcohol, and especially weight control deserve a high priority.},

Design~         The Syst-Eur study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, powered to detect differences in stroke rate between participants on active antihypertensive treatment and placebo. Systolic blood pressure variability measurements were made on 744 participants at the start of the trial. Systolic blood pressure variability was calculated over three time frames: 24 h, daytime and night-time. The placebo and active treatment subgroups were analysed separately using an intention-to-treat principle, adjusting for confounding factors using a multiple Cox regression model.         Participants~         An elderly hypertensive European population.         Main outcome measures~         Stroke, cardiac events (fatal and non-fatal heart failure, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and sudden death) and cardiovascular mortality (death attributed to stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, sudden death, pulmonary embolus, peripheral vascular disease and aortic dissection).         Results~         The risk of stroke increased by 80\% (95\% confidence interval: 17–176\%) for every 5 mmHg increase in night-time systolic blood pressure variability in the placebo group. Risk of cardiovascular mortality and cardiac events was not significantly altered. Daytime variability readings did not predict outcome. Antihypertensive treatment did not affect systolic blood pressure variability over the median 4.4-year follow-up.         Conclusion~         In the placebo group, but not the active treatment group, increased night-time systolic blood pressure variability on admission to the Syst-Eur trial was an independent risk factor for stroke during the trial.},
