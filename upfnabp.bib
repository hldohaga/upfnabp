  abstract = {There is increased interest in the novel approach of classifying food based on the nature of its processing and its contribution towards diet-related diseases. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to determine the relationship between this novel food classification system and nutritional status of adults in Kuala Nerus, Terengganu. This cross-sectional study involved 200 respondents aged 18 years and above. A self- and researcher-administered questionnaire consisting of three different parts, namely a sociodemographic profile, nutritional status assessment, and food classification system (via two days 24 hours dietary recall) was used to collect data. SPSS version 20.0 was used for data analysis. Results showed that energy contributions of respondents were dominated by foods from group 1 and group 2 i.e. unprocessed food, minimally processed food and processed culinary ingredients. The energy contribution from ultra-processed food consumption was 24\% of the average total daily energy consumption at 1818 kcal. The average nutritional status of respondents showed both BMI (M = 25.33, IQR = 6.79) and body fat percentage (M = 28.01, SD = 9.08) were overweight. Further data, including waist circumferences (M = 84.57 cm, SD = 11.7); fasting blood glucose level (M = 5.3 mmol/L, IQR = 0.80); total cholesterol (M = 4.60 mmol/L, IQR = 1.6); triglycerides (M = 1.00 mmol/L, IQR = 0.44); and LDL level (M = 2.74 mmol/L, IQR = 1.35) were normal. Systolic blood pressure (M = 112.50 mmHg, IQR = 20) and diastolic blood pressure (M = 78.84mmHg, SD = 11.73) were optimal, and the HDL levels of the respondents were borderline (M = 1.42mmol/L, IQR = 0.47). Pearson and Spearman correlations were performed to determine the relationship between ultra-processed food consumption and nutritional status and found no significant relationship between both variables. All in all, the findings can be used in the development of evidence-based interventions aimed at encouraging the consumption of minimally processed foods and reducing ultra-processed food consumption among the general public.},

Methods In this cross-sectional study, patients underwent clinical, laboratory, and nutritional evaluations. Dietary intake was assessed by a quantitative food frequency questionnaire and eating patterns identified by cluster analysis. The therapeutic targets were as follows: blood pressure, \textexclamdown 140/90 mm Hg; BMI, \textexclamdown 25 kg/m2 (\textexclamdown 27 kg/m2 for elderly); waist circumference, \textexclamdown 94 cm for men and \textexclamdown 80 cm for women; fasting plasma glucose, \textexclamdown 130 mg/dL; HbA1c, \textexclamdown 7\%; triglycerides, \textexclamdown 150 mg/dL; HDL-cholesterol, \textquestiondown 40 mg/dL for men and \textquestiondown 50 mg/dL for women; LDL-cholesterol, \textexclamdown 100 mg/dL. Results One hundred ninety seven patients were studied. We identified two eating patterns: "unhealthy" (n = 100)-high consumption of refined carbohydrates, ultra-processed foods, sweets and desserts (P \textexclamdown{} 0.05); and "healthy" (n = 97)-high intake of whole carbohydrates, dairy, white meat, fish, fruits and vegetables (P \textexclamdown{} 0.05). The healthy group more frequently achieved therapeutic targets for fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and LDL-cholesterol than the unhealthy group. Poisson regression confirmed the association of healthy eating pattern with attaining the therapeutic target for fasting plasma glucose [PR, 1.59 (95\% CI, 1.01 to 2.34); P = 0.018], HbA1c [PR, 2.09 (95\% CI, 1.17 to 3.74); P = 0.013], and LDL-cholesterol [PR, 1.37 (95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.86); P = 0.042]. Conclusions A healthy eating pattern, including the frequent intake of whole carbohydrates, dairy, white meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables, is associated with reduced fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. We evaluate the relationship between two eating patterns (healthy and unhealthy) and therapeutic targets (blood pressure, body weight, glycemic index, and lipid profile) in 197 patients with type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {Shifting food environments in Latin America have potentially contributed to an increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, along with decreases in healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables. Yet, little is known about the impact that such changes in the food environment have on blood pressure in low- and middle-income countries, including Mexico. We utilized individual-level systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) measures from the 2016 Mexican Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT, n = 2798 adults). Using an inventory of food stores based on the economic census for 2010 and 2016, we calculated the change in the density of fruit and vegetable stores, convenience stores, and supermarkets. Multilevel regression was used to estimate the association between the 2010\textendash 2016 food environment neighborhood-level changes with individual-level blood pressure measured in 2016. Declines in neighborhood-level density of fruit and vegetable stores were associated with higher individual SBP (2.67 mmHg, 95\% CI: 0.1, 5.2) in unadjusted models, and marginally associated after controlling for individual-level and area-level covariates. Increases in the density of supermarkets were associated with higher blood pressure outcomes among adults with undiagnosed hypertension. Structural interventions targeting the retail food environment could potentially contribute to better nutrition-related health outcomes in Latin American cities.},

This systematic review analyzed evidence of the association between consumption of processed/ultra-processed foods and arterial hypertension in adults and older people. Electronic searches for relevant articles were performed in the PUBMED, EMBASE and LILACS databases. The review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and the Newcastle\textendash Ottawa Scale. The search of the databases led to the retrieval of 2323 articles, eight of which were included in the review. A positive association was found between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and blood pressure/arterial hypertension, whereas insufficient evidence was found for the association between the consumption of processed foods and arterial hypertension. The results reveal the high consumption of ultra-processed foods in developed and middle-income countries, warning of the health risks of such foods, which have a high energy density and are rich in salt, sugar and fat. The findings underscore the urgent need for the adoption of measures that exert a positive impact on the quality of life of populations, especially those at greater risk, such as adults and older people.},

  abstract = {Background Taste of food may be important in food choice and dietary intakes. While taste perception in the laboratory has been widely studied, it has rarely been taken into account when exploring dietary patterns in a population. The aim of this work is to identify consumers' taste perceptions for a list of commonly consumed foods.Methods The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) rolling programme year 9 (2016/17) was used to generate a list of foods consumed by adolescents (10\textendash 19 years old). 1748 different foods were grouped by food group, and sugar/salt contents into seven main and 23 subgroups. A pilot test was conducted to identify foods with high taste agreement to further limit the list. The shortened food list was included in an online food-taste classification survey which was distributed to Facebook groups and Twitter. Participants were asked to allocate one main taste of the five basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, bitter or savoury/umami) to each food. Additionally, neutral and never tried options were provided. To minimize participant burden, the food list was divided into three and participants were asked to complete one part with an option to voluntarily complete the rest. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to allocate foods into taste clusters. Number of clusters was determined based on the elbow method. Cluster linkage method used was based on a dendrogram and cophenetic correlation coefficient (CPCC).Results The pilot questionnaire was completed by 19 participants. 15/19 rated 55 foods as the same taste and these were removed from the final questionnaire. The final food list contained 184 items. The main online questionnaire obtained 209 responses from 162 females, 44 males, (3 not known). The age range was from 18\textendash 70+ years with the majority between 40\textendash 59 years old. Seven reported having had COVID-19, but only three were tested positive (none experienced a taste loss). Cluster analysis classified foods into 6 taste clusters using the Average weighted linkage (CPCC=71\%). Foods were classified as 21\% sweet, 9\% salty, 9\% sour, 13\% bitter, 18\% savoury, and 29\% neutral. These tastes have been applied to all the foods consumed by adolescents reported in the NDNS to generate taste patterns allowing us to explore links with diet and nutritional quality and anthropometry.Conclusion We have characterised basic tastes for foods reported in the NDNS. This will allow us to create a UK food-taste database to explore dietary-taste patterns in the NDNS.}

This study assessed potassium intake; food sources of potassium (including NOVA level of processing, purchase origin of these foods); and sodium-to-potassium ratio (Na:K) in a cross-section of Australian adults. Data collection included 24-h urines (n = 338) and a 24-h diet recall (subsample n = 142). The mean (SD) age of participants was 41.2 (13.9) years and 56\% were females. Mean potassium (95\%CI) 24-h urinary excretion was 76.8 (73.0-80.5) mmol/day compared to 92.9 (86.6-99.1) by 24-h diet recall. Na:K was 1.9 (1.8-2.0) from the urine excretion and 1.4 (1.2-1.7) from diet recall. Foods contributing most to potassium were potatoes (8\%), dairy milk (6\%), dishes where cereal is the main ingredient (6\%) and coffee/coffee substitutes (5\%). Over half of potassium (56\%) came from minimally processed foods, with 22\% from processed and 22\% from ultraprocessed foods. Almost two-thirds of potassium consumed was from foods purchased from food stores (58\%), then food service sector (15\%), and fresh food markets (13\%). Overall, potassium levels were lower than recommended to reduce chronic disease risk. Multifaceted efforts are required for population-wide intervention aimed at increasing fruit, vegetable, and other key sources of potassium intake; reducing consumption of processed foods; and working in supermarket/food service sector settings to improve the healthiness of foods available.},

The aim was to measure Na intake, food sources of Na (level of processing, purchase origin) and discretionary salt use in a cross-section of Victorian adults prior to a salt reduction initiative. In 2016/2017, participants completed a 24-h urine collection (n 338) and a subsample completed a 24-h dietary recall (n 142). Participants were aged 41 center dot 2 (sd 13 center dot 9) years, and 56 \% were females. Mean 24-h urinary excretion was 138 (95 \% CI 127, 149) mmol/d for Na. Salt equivalent was 8 center dot 1 (95 \% CI 7 center dot 4, 8 center dot 7) g/d, equating to about 8 center dot 9 (95 \% CI 8 center dot 1, 9 center dot 6) g/d after 10 \% adjustment for non-urinary losses. Mean 24-h intake estimated by diet recall was 118 (95 \% CI 103, 133) mmol/d for Na (salt 6 center dot 9 (95 \% CI 6 center dot 0, 7 center dot 8 g/d)). Leading dietary sources of Na were cereal-based mixed dishes (12 \%), English muffins, flat/savoury/sweet breads (9 \%), regular breads/rolls (9 \%), gravies and savoury sauces (7 \%) and processed meats (7 \%). Over one-third (38 \%) of Na consumed was derived from discretionary foods. Half of all Na consumed came from ultra-processed foods. Dietary Na derived from foods was obtained from retail stores (51 \%), restaurants and fast-food/takeaway outlets (28 \%) and fresh food markets (9 \%). One-third (32 \%) of participants reported adding salt at the table and 61 \% added salt whilst cooking. This study revealed that salt intake was above recommended levels with diverse sources of intake. Results from this study suggest a multi-faceted salt reduction strategy focusing on the retail sector, and food reformulation would most likely benefit Victorians and has been used to inform the ongoing statewide salt reduction initiative.},

Based on 60 interviews, 191 passages about worry and 58 passages about stress were analyzed using discourse analysis. Participants not only distinguished between worry and stress in their everyday lives, but they also highlighted how those concepts were interrelated. Participants' concerns about themselves as well as their children, kin, and community were emphasized in passages about worry. Stress was primarily associated with doing multiple tasks and confronting multiple prejudices in the workplace and surrounding community. Participants perceived worry and stress as important health-related concepts that affected their high blood pressure. Nursing strategies designed to address these concerns may better facilitate holistic health.},

  abstract = {To date, Ontario public health units (PHUs) have generally neglected the social determinants of health (SDH) concept in favor of risk aversion and behaviorally oriented health promotion approaches. Addressing SDH and responding to the presence of health inequities is required under the Ontario Public Health Standards and is a component of provincial public health documents and reports. Nevertheless, units vary in their understanding and application of the SDH concept in their activities. The authors conducted 18 interviews with Medical Officers of Health and lead staff persons from nine Ontario PHUs, in order to better understand how these differences in addressing the SDH among health units come about. The findings suggest that differences in practice largely result from epistemological variations: conceptions of the SDH; the perceived role of public health in addressing them; and understandings concerning the validity of differing forms of evidence and expected outcomes. Drawing from Bachelard's concept of epistemological barriers and Raphael's seven discourses on the SDH, we examine the ways in which the participating units discuss and apply the SDH concepts. We argue that a substantial barrier to further action on the SDH is the internalization of discourses and traditions that treat health as individualized and depoliticized.},

COVID-19 mitigation strategies have unintended consequences on managing chronic conditions such as hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and health disparities in the United States. During the first wave of the pandemic in the United States, the combination of observed racial/ethnic inequities in COVID-19 deaths and social unrest reinvigorated a national conversation about systemic racism in health care and society. The 4th Annual University of Utah Translational Hypertension Symposium gathered frontline clinicians, researchers, and leaders from diverse backgrounds to discuss the intersection of these 2 critical social and public health phenomena and to highlight preexisting disparities in hypertension treatment and control exacerbated by COVID-19. The discussion underscored environmental and socioeconomic factors that are deeply embedded in US health care and research that impact inequities in hypertension. Structural racism plays a central role at both the health system and individual levels. At the same time, virtual healthcare platforms are being accelerated into widespread use by COVID-19, which may widen the divide in healthcare access across levels of wealth, geography, and education. Blood pressure control rates are declining, especially among communities of color and those without health insurance or access to health care. Hypertension awareness, therapeutic lifestyle changes, and evidence-based pharmacotherapy are essential. There is a need to improve the implementation of community-based interventions and blood pressure self-monitoring, which can help build patient trust and increase healthcare engagement.},

The UnProcessed Pantry Project (UP3) is an intervention aimed to reduce ultra-processed food availability and consumption of food pantry clients accessing the emergency food system. The pilot study included nutrition education, food boxes, and social support for 16 weeks at 2 food pantries. Data collection included the ASA24 dietary recall to calculate Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) scores, biomarkers (hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, blood pressure, waist circumference, body mass index [BMI]), and a demographic and psychosocial survey. Dietary quality among 43 participants significantly (P \textexclamdown{} .05) improved as measured by the HEI-2015 for total HEI-2015, whole grains, total protein foods, and added sugars scores. BMI, total cholesterol, and waist circumference also significantly improved across study participants. Findings indicate that the emergency food system may be an effective access point to apply frameworks including UP3 to address ultra-processed food consumption, dietary quality, and noncommunicable chronic disease risk among food-insecure populations. Programs and policies that limit the amount of ultra-processed food in the emergency food system should be further tested and could be efficacious in addressing inequities among vulnerable populations.},

  abstract = {Current salt consumption in human societies is now much greater than needed for survival. Furthermore, high salt intake substantially increases blood pressure (BP) in both animals and humans. Conversely, a reduction in salt intake causes a dosedependent reduction in BP in men and women of all ages and ethnic groups and in patients already on medication. The risk of strokes and heart attacks rises with increasing BP but can be decreased by antihypertensive drugs. However, the majority of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events occur in the numerous individuals with ``normal'' BP levels below the ``clinically hypertensive'' level which might trigger drug therapy. Nonpharmacological prevention is therefore the only option to reduce the majority of such events. Reductions in population salt intake consistently reduce the number of subsequent CVD events (with additional benefits for the heart, kidneys, stomach, and skeleton). Indeed, this is one of the most important public health measures for reducing the global CVD burden. The most successful policies involve comprehensive which ideally include population monitoring, health education, and reformulation to reduce the salt content concealed in processed foods (which represent over 75\% of daily salt intake). Such population-wide salt reduction policies are generally powerful, rapid, equitable, and cost saving. Inevitably, the food and beverage industries, which profit from marketing salt, will try to oppose such policies. However, public health has triumphed in those countries prepared to consider the necessary levers: regulation, legislation, and even taxation. A comprehensive reformulation strategy for processed foods can provide an effective first step.},

  abstract = {Background The association between higher consumption of industrially ultra-processed foods (UPF) and adverse health outcomes, including obesity, is increasingly evident. Furthermore, health outcomes such as obesity show pronounced social gradients in the UK. As a high-income country, we might expect higher UPF consumption in the lowest socio-economic position (SEP). However, the evidence for UK social gradients in UPF intake is scarce. We therefore evaluated the association between UPF intakes and measurements of SEP. Methods We used data from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008\textendash 18), with dietary intakes based on four-day food diaries. To quantify UPF consumption, we classified the extent of industrial food processing for each food and beverage using the NOVA classification, then calculated UPF intake in grams, and percentage of daily energy. As markers of SEP, we used household income and education, plus the English IMD 2015, Welsh IMD 2014, Scottish IMD 2016, and Northern Ireland IMD 2017. We created multiple linear regression models to explore potential associations between UPF intake and SEP, all adjusted for age, sex, UK region and NDNS survey year. Results In the UK, UPF accounted for over 60\% of the daily energy, having increased from 57\% in 2008 to 63\% in 2018. UPF consumption was higher in men than in women (59\% vs. 57\%, p{$<$}0.01), and in younger participants than in older ones (67\% in less than 14-year-old vs. 55\% in 75 and older, p{$<$}0.01).UPF consumption was also consistently higher in more deprived groups. Thus 9 percentage points (pp) (CI95\%: [5;12]) higher in households earning less than \textsterling 5,000/year than in those earning over \textsterling 100,000, 17pp ([5;28]) higher in those with less education, 4pp ([3;5]) higher in those in routine occupations than those in managerial and professional occupations, and 3pp ([2;4]) higher in the most deprived IMD quintiles compared with the most affluent. All results were similar using gram of UPF. Conclusion In the UK, ultra-processed food now accounts for over 60\% of total energy intake and has increased over the last decade. Although high energy intakes from UPF were seen in all social groups, our analyses consistently demonstrated even higher UPF consumption among the most deprived groups. These analyses offer potentially important messages for future UK food and inequalities policies.},

Simultaneously, Martinique has faced a demographic transition marked by significant population ageing. We aimed to differentiate the contribution of changes in health status and dietary intakes due to shifts in demographic and socio-economic characteristics (DSEC) from that due to unobserved factors. Design: Two cross-sectional surveys conducted in 2003 (n 743) and 2013 (n 573) on representative samples were used. Dietary intakes were estimated by 24-h recalls. The contribution of changes in health status and dietary intakes due to shifts in observed DSEC was differentiated from that due to unobserved factors over a 10-year interval, using Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition models. Setting: Martinique, French region in the Caribbean. Participants: Martinican adults (\textquestiondown = 16 years). Results: Over the study period, health status deteriorated, partly owing to shifts in DSEC, explaining 62 \% of the change in the prevalence of hypertension (+13 percentage points (pp)) and 48 \% of waist circumference change (+3 cm). Diet quality decreased (mean adequacy ratio -2pp and mean excess ratio + 2 pp) and energy supplied by ultra-processed food increased (+4 pp). Shifts in DSEC marginally explained some changes in dietary intakes (e.g. increased diet quality), while the changes that remained unexplained were of opposite sign, with decreased diet quality, lower fruits, tubers and fish intakes and higher energy provided by ultra-processed foods. Conclusion: Explained dietary changes were of opposite sign to nutrition transition conceptual framework, probably because unobserved drivers are in play, such as food price trends or supermarkets spread.},

ASTRACT Objective: To evaluate the consumption of ultra-processed foods and related factors in adolescents. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 784 adolescents (both sexes and aged between 12 and 19 years) from public and private schools in the municipality of Palmeira das Miss\~oes, Brazil. Food consumption was recorded by the semiquantitative questionnaire of frequency of food consumption and converted to energy (kcal/day). Foods were classified as minimally processed, group 1 (G1); processed foods, group 2 (G2); and ultra-processed foods, group 3 (G3). The variables evaluated were sex, socioeconomic class, color, physical activity, body mass index, and blood pressure levels. In the comparison of quantitative variables, the Mann-Whitney test and the Kruskal-Wallis H test were used. To adjust the differences between the groups, considering the effects of total calories, the covariance analysis test (ANCOVA) was applied. Results: The median of the total energy consumption was 3,039.8 kcal, and that of ultra-processed foods was 1,496.5 kcal/day (49.23\%). The caloric intake from foods in G1, G2, and G3 did not differ according to the skin color of the adolescents. Those belonging to socioeconomic classes C and D are the most frequent consumers of calories from G2 and G3 (p\textexclamdown 0.001). Underactive teens consume fewer calories from minimally processed foods. Eutrophic adolescents present higher consumption of G3 foods (p\textexclamdown 0.001) when compared to those who are overweight. Conclusions: The consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with socioeconomic level, physical activity level, and nutritional status.},

  abstract = {Brazil's Family Health Strategy (FHS) leads public health policies and actions regarding community health, addressing arterial hypertension (AH) in primary care settings. In this scenario, the use of communication technologies becomes appropriate for the monitoring of patients with AH. To preliminary verify the intervention approach and the effects of using an m-Health application on the health conditions of patients with AH for a future study, we conducted a non-randomized, controlled, non-blind trial (N = 39), comparing the use of a mobile health app (m-Health) with conventional AH monitoring over 3 months. During the study, we promoted health information workshops to engage patients from both intervention and control groups. Pre and post-intervention, we compared measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure; food frequency questionnaire; Appraisal of Self-Care Agency Scale; blood tests of hemogram, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, lipid profile, and glycemia. Improvements were identified in both groups due to the workshops, including the reduction in total and non-HDL cholesterol, healthier consumption of salads and sugary drinks, and increased self-care scores. Exclusively in the intervention group, which used the m-Health app, there was a change in systolic and diastolic pressure towards more adequate levels. In addition, the intervention group had improved levels of glucose and HDL cholesterol and reduced consumption of ultra-processed foods. In conclusion, the use of an m-Health app had positive effects on the health conditions of patients with AH under treatment within FHS, especially when combined with health information. On the context of FHS, the use of technology is encouraging supporting better health conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Some available evidence suggests that high consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is associated with a higher risk of obesity. Collectively, this association and the nutritional characteristics of UPFs suggest that UPFs might also be associated with hypertension. METHODS We prospectively evaluated the relationship between UPF consumption and the risk of hypertension in a prospective Spanish cohort, the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra project. We included 14,790 Spanish adult university graduates who were initially free of hypertension at baseline who were followed for a mean of 9.1 years (SD, 3.9 years; total person-years: 134,784). UPF (industrial formulations of chemical compounds which, beyond substances of common culinary use such as salt, sugar, oils, and fats, include substances also derived from foods but not used in culinary preparations) consumption was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative 136-item food-frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for hypertension incidence. RESULTS During follow-up, 1,702 incident cases of hypertension were identified. Participants in the highest tertile of UPF consumption had a higher risk of developing hypertension (adjusted HR, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.06, 1.37; P for trend = 0.004) than those in the lowest tertile after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS In this large prospective cohort of Spanish middle-aged adult university graduates, a positive association between UPF consumption and hypertension risk was observed. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our results.},

Our aim in this review is to summarize recent research assessing the impact of UPF consumption, classified according to the NOVA system, on outcomes related to metabolic health. Recent findings Thirty recent studies with different design, quality and target population have investigated the impact of UPF consumption on parameters related to metabolic health, which were organized into: metabolic syndrome; body weight change and obesity indicators; blood pressure and hypertension; glucose profile, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes; other metabolic risks and cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Most of the studies demonstrated adverse associations between high UPF consumption and metabolic health, mainly those with robust design and involving adults. Most of the latest findings have revealed an adverse impact of high UPF consumption on metabolic health, including cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Scientific evidence is accumulating towards the necessity of curbing UPF consumption worldwide at different life stages. Nevertheless, other studies are needed to confirm the causality between UPF consumption and metabolic health in diverse scenarios and to better elucidate all likely mechanisms involved in this relationship.},

  abstract = {Unhealthy diets are a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases and negatively impact environmental sustainability. Policy actions recommended to address dietary risk factors, such as restrictions on marketing and front-of-pack labelling, are informed by nutrition classification schemes (NCSs). Ultra-processed foods are associated with adverse population and planetary health outcomes, yet the concept is rarely incorporated in nutrition classification schemes for policy actions. This study aims to develop a novel food processing-based nutrition classification scheme for guiding policy actions. A secondary aim is to validate the scheme by classifying food and beverage items in the Australian food supply (face validity) and comparing them to the classifications of existing NCSs (convergent validity). Two versions of a model were developed, classifying foods and beverages in two steps, first using the NOVA classification system and secondly by applying upper thresholds for added free sugars and sodium, producing a binary output of either healthy or unhealthy. All food and beverage items (n = 7,322) in a dataset combining the Australian Food Composition Database (AUSNUT 2011\textendash 2013) and Mintel's Global New Product Database (2014\textendash 2019) were classified using the two models. The same dataset was also classified by the Health Star Rating system (HSR), The Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADGs), The Pan American Health Organization's Nutrient Profile Model (PAHO NPM), and the NOVA classification scheme, and pairwise agreement between all NCSs and the two models was determined (using Cohen's Kappa coefficient). A higher proportion of food categories consistent with dietary patterns that are associated with positive health outcomes, such and fruits, vegetables, and eggs were classified as healthy. And the clear majority of food categories consistent with dietary patterns associated with adverse health outcomes, such as confectionery, snack foods, and convenience foods were classified as unhealthy. The two versions of the model showed substantial agreement with NOVA and the PAHO NPM, fair agreement with the ADGs and slight to moderate agreement with the HSR system. A model NCS combining level of processing and nutrient criteria presents a valid alternative to existing methods to classify the health potential of individual foods for policy purposes.},

METHOD  Two independent evaluators analyzed the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science and Lilacs until December 2018. We used the following terms: (convenience foods OR food processing OR highly-processed OR industrialized foods OR minimally-processed OR prepared foods OR processed foods OR ultra-processed OR ultraprocessed OR ultra processed OR unprocessed) AND (metabolic syndrome OR hypertension OR blood pressure OR diabetes mellitus OR glucose OR glycaemia OR insulin OR cholesterol OR triglycerides OR blood lipids OR overweight OR obesity) AND (adult OR adults OR adulthood OR aged OR elderly OR old). We assessed methodological and evidence qualities, and also extracted information for the qualitative synthesis from the selected studies. RESULTS  Of the 6,423 studies identified after removing duplicates, eleven met the eligibility criteria. The main food classification we used was Nova. The consumption of ultra-processed foods was positively associated with overweight and obesity, high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome. All articles included met more than 50\% of the methodological quality criteria. The quality of evidence was considered moderate for the outcome overweight and obesity and weak for hypertension and metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS  The Nova food classification stands out in the area of nutritional epidemiology when assessing the effects of food processing on health outcomes. Although caution is required in the interpretation, the results indicated that the consumption of ultra-processed foods can have an unfavorable impact in the health of individuals.},

Design: Standardised cross sectional study within and across populations. Setting: 52 population samples in 32 countries. Subjects: 10 074 men and women aged 20-59. Main outcome measures: Association of sodium and blood pressure from within population and cross population multiple linear regression analyses with multivariate correction for regression dilution bias. Relation of sample median daily urinary sodium excretion to difference in blood pressure with age. Results: In within population analyses (n=10 074), individual 24 hour urinary sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol (for example, 170 v 70 mmol) was associated with systolic/diastolic blood pressure higher on average by 3/0 to 6/3 mm Hg (with and without body mass in analyses). Associations were larger at ages 40-59. In cross population analyses (n=52), sample median 24 hour sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol was associated with median systolic/diastolic pressure higher on average by 5-7/2-4 mm Hg, and estimated mean difference in systolic/diastolic pressure at age 55 compared with age 25 greater by 10-11/6 mm Hg. Conclusions: The strong, positive association of urinary sodium with systolic pressure of individuals concurs with Intersalt cross population findings and results of other studies. Higher urinary sodium is also associated with substantially greater differences in blood pressure in middle age compared with young adulthood. These results support recommendations for reduction of high salt intake in populations for prevention and control of adverse blood pressure levels. Key messages The within population findings were previously underestimated because of incomplete correction for the regression dilution problemRevised estimates of the within population association of sodium to blood pressure in Intersalt are concordant with the cross population findings for 52 samplesEstimates of the effect of median sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol/day over a 30 year period (age 55 minus age 25) were a greater difference of 10-11 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 6 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressureThese results lend further support to recommendations for mass reduction of high salt intake for the prevention and control of adverse blood pressure levels and high blood pressure in populations},

  abstract = {Background The benefits of blood pressure lowering treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease are well established. However, the extent to which these effects differ by baseline blood pressure, presence of comorbidities, or drug class is less clear. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify these differences. Method For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE for large-scale blood pressure lowering trials, published between Jan 1, 1966, and July 7, 2015, and we searched the medical literature to identify trials up to Nov 9, 2015. All randomised controlled trials of blood pressure lowering treatment were eligible for inclusion if they included a minimum of 1000 patient-years of follow-up in each study arm. No trials were excluded because of presence of baseline comorbidities, and trials of antihypertensive drugs for indications other than hypertension were eligible. We extracted summary-level data about study characteristics and the outcomes of major cardiovascular disease events, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. We used inverse variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool the estimates. Results We identified 123 studies with 613\hphantom{,}815 participants for the tabular meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses showed relative risk reductions proportional to the magnitude of the blood pressure reductions achieved. Every 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular disease events (relative risk [RR] 0{$\cdot$}80, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}77\textendash 0{$\cdot$}83), coronary heart disease (0{$\cdot$}83, 0{$\cdot$}78\textendash 0{$\cdot$}88), stroke (0{$\cdot$}73, 0{$\cdot$}68\textendash 0{$\cdot$}77), and heart failure (0{$\cdot$}72, 0{$\cdot$}67\textendash 0{$\cdot$}78), which, in the populations studied, led to a significant 13\% reduction in all-cause mortality (0{$\cdot$}87, 0{$\cdot$}84\textendash 0{$\cdot$}91). However, the effect on renal failure was not significant (0{$\cdot$}95, 0{$\cdot$}84\textendash 1{$\cdot$}07). Similar proportional risk reductions (per 10 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure) were noted in trials with higher mean baseline systolic blood pressure and trials with lower mean baseline systolic blood pressure (all ptrend{$>$}0{$\cdot$}05). There was no clear evidence that proportional risk reductions in major cardiovascular disease differed by baseline disease history, except for diabetes and chronic kidney disease, for which smaller, but significant, risk reductions were detected. {$\beta$} blockers were inferior to other drugs for the prevention of major cardiovascular disease events, stroke, and renal failure. Calcium channel blockers were superior to other drugs for the prevention of stroke. For the prevention of heart failure, calcium channel blockers were inferior and diuretics were superior to other drug classes. Risk of bias was judged to be low for 113 trials and unclear for 10 trials. Heterogeneity for outcomes was low to moderate; the I2 statistic for heterogeneity for major cardiovascular disease events was 41\%, for coronary heart disease 25\%, for stroke 26\%, for heart failure 37\%, for renal failure 28\%, and for all-cause mortality 35\%. Interpretation Blood pressure lowering significantly reduces vascular risk across various baseline blood pressure levels and comorbidities. Our results provide strong support for lowering blood pressure to systolic blood pressures less than 130 mm Hg and providing blood pressure lowering treatment to individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.

This is significant, as uncertainty is associated with a variety of troublesome economic and clinical indicators. Researchers have identified the three types of cognitive resources needed to combat uncertainty (technical, personal, or conceptual), as well as the affective stress reactions physicians have when confronted with uncertainty. In this study, we explored the relationship between primary care physicians' stress reactions to uncertainty and the conceptual resource of epistemology. METHODS: Using Likert-type measures of epistemology and stress reactions to uncertainty, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with 78 board-certified and resident physicians in primary care. A simple bivariate regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between epistemology and stress reactions to uncertainty (Model 1), and a multivariate regression analysis was performed to test for the independent effect of epistemology on stress reactions to uncertainty while controlling for gender, specialty, and professional development status (Model 2). RESULTS: Physician epistemology and stress reactions to uncertainty were significantly related in both models. CONCLUSIONS: Among primary care physicians, a biopsychosocial epistemology is associated with less stress reactions to uncertainty, and a biomedical epistemology is associated with more stress reactions to uncertainty.},

Ultra-processed foods contribute similar to 80\% of dietary salt in high income countries, and are becoming prominent in low-middle income countries. Instant noodle consumption is particularly high in the Asia Pacific region. The aim of this study was to compare the sodium content of instant noodles sold worldwide to identify potential for reformulation. Analysis was undertaken for 765 instant noodle products from 10 countries using packaged food composition databases of ultra-processed foods compiled by the Global Food Monitoring Group (GFMG) and national shop survey data. Sodium levels were high and variable, within and between countries. Instant noodles in China had the highest mean sodium content (1944 mg/100 g; range: 397-3678/100 g) compared to New Zealand (798 mg/100 g; range: 249-2380 mg/100 g). Average pack size ranged from 57 g (Costa Rica) to 98 g (China). The average packet contributed 35\% to 95\% of the World Health Organization recommended daily salt intake of \textexclamdown{} 5 g. Forty-one percent of products met the Pacific Island (PICs) regional sodium targets, 37\% met the South Africa 2016 targets, and 62\% met the UK 2017 targets.

This study evaluated the impact of different policy scenarios for reducing sodium consumption from processed and ultra-processed foods in the prevention of deaths due to cardiovascular outcomes in the adult population in Brazil. We used secondary data from public reports and databases of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) and population surveys. We analyzed the impacts, up to 2027 of three scenarios: maintenance of the current voluntary targets, and two mandatory scenarios, considering the lowest targets in the Americas and the lowest global targets. The Preventable Risk Integrated ModE1 (PRIME) analyzed the deaths prevented or delayed from sodium consumption in such scenarios. In 2027 more than 72,000 deaths would be attributed to excess sodium; the voluntary goals would result in the prevention or postponement of up to 4,001 (95\% uncertainty intervals - 95\%UI: 1,611-6,563) deaths, while the mandatory scenarios would result in the prevention of 9,704 (95\%UI: 3,955-15,665) and 15,561 (95\%UI 6,350-25,096) deaths from cardiovascular diseases, considering the lower regional and international targets, respectively. The findings suggest that the maintenance of voluntary targets has limited impact when compared to possible and more restrictive scenarios of reducing sodium content in processed and ultra-processed foods and reinforce the need to adopt measures with greater effectiveness in the country.},

To better understand the effects of a diet high in fat, sugar, and sodium on cerebrovascular function, Sprague Dawley rats were chronically exposed to a Cafeteria diet. Resting cerebral perfusion and cerebrovascular reactivity was quantified using continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, structural changes to the cerebrovasculature and susceptibility to ischemic lesion were examined. Compared to control animals fed standard chow (SD), Cafeteria diet (CAF) rats exhibited increased resting brain perfusion in the hippocampus and reduced cerebrovascular reactivity in response to 10\% inspired CO2 challenges in both the hippocampus and the neocortex. CAF rats switched to chow for one month (SWT) exhibited improved resting perfusion in the hippocampus as well as improved cerebrovascular reactivity in the neocortex. However, the diet switch did not correct cerebrovascular reactivity in the hippocampus. These changes were not accompanied by alterations in the structural integrity of the cerebral microvasculature, examined using rat endothelial cell antigen-1 (RECA-1) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunostaining. Also, the extent of tissue damage induced by endothelin-1 injection into sensorimotor cortex was not affected by the Cafeteria diet. These results demonstrate that short-term consumption of an ultra-processed diet reduces cerebrovascular reactivity. This effect persists after dietary normalization despite recovery of peripheral symptomatology.},

Design: National school-based survey. Setting: Blood pressure, weight and height were measured, and characteristics of the schools were obtained in interviews with the principals. For each outcome, multilevel models of mixed effects were applied by logistic regression. Participants: School-going adolescents aged 12-17 years. Results: A total of 73 399 adolescents were evaluated. The prevalence of hypertension was 9 center dot 6 (95 \% CI 9 center dot 0, 10 center dot 3) \% and that of obesity was 8 center dot 4 (95 \% CI 7 center dot 9, 8 center dot 9) \%. Approximately 50 \% of the adolescents were able to purchase food at school and in its immediate vicinity and 82 \% had access to no-charge meals through Brazil's National School Feeding Program. In the adjusted analysis, hypertension was associated (OR; 95 \% CI) with the consumption of meals prepared on the school premises (0 center dot 79; 0 center dot 69, 0 center dot 92), the sale of food in the school's immediate vicinity (0 center dot 67; 0 center dot 48, 0 center dot 95) and the purchase of food in the school cafeteria (1 center dot 29; 1 center dot 11, 1 center dot 49). It was observed that there were lower odds of obesity among students who were offered meals prepared on the school premises (0 center dot 68; 0 center dot 54, 0 center dot 87). Conclusions: High frequency of sales of ultra-processed foods in schools was identified. Contextual and individual characteristics in the school food environment were associated with hypertension and obesity, pointing to the need for regulation and supervision of these spaces.},

  abstract = {Background Increasing trends in global obesity have been attributed to a nutrition transition where healthy foods are replaced by ultra-processed foods. It remains unknown if this nutrition transition has occurred in Venezuela, a country undergoing a socio-political crisis with widespread food shortages. Methods We described dietary intake of Venezuelans from a nationally representative study conducted between 2014 and 2017. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of dietary, sociodemographic, and clinical data from Venezuelans \textquestiondown = 20 years of age (n = 3420). Dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Standardized clinical and anthropometric measurements estimated obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. A Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) was calculated using an amended Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women score where the range was 0 to 8 food groups, with 8 being the most diverse. Analyses accounted for complex survey design by estimating weighted frequencies of dietary intake and DDS across sociodemographic and cardiometabolic risk-based subgroups. Results The prevalence of obesity was 24.6\% (95\% CI: 21.6-27.7), type 2 diabetes was 13.3\% (11.2-15.7), and hypertension was 30.8\% (27.7-34.0). Western foods were consumed infrequently. Most frequently consumed foods included coffee, arepas (a salted corn flour cake), and cheese. Mean DDS was 2.3 food groups (Range: 0-8, Standard Error: 0.07) and this score did not vary among subgroups. Men, younger individuals, and those with higher socioeconomic status were more likely to consume red meat and soft drinks once or more weekly. Women and those with higher socioeconomic status were more likely to consume vegetables and cheese once or more daily. Participants with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension had lower daily intake of red meat and arepas compared to participants without these risk factors. Conclusions Despite high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors, adults in Venezuela have not gone through a nutrition transition similar to that observed elsewhere in Latin America. Dietary diversity is low and widely consumed food groups that are considered unhealthy are part of the traditional diet. Future studies are needed in Venezuela using more comprehensive measurements of dietary intake to understand the effect of the socio-political crisis on dietary patterns and cardiometabolic risk factors.},

  abstract = {The objective of this research is to study and look at the ways how processed food affects human and environmental health and to find alternatives to processed food. Sustainability refers to the efforts made to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to fulfil their requirements. Sustainability aims at environment-friendly progress and development. World Health Organization defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Processed food is any food that has been changed in its form and nature by using certain processing techniques such as freezing, canning and dehydrating. The focus of this research is ``ultra-processed foods''. Ultra-processed foods are the final food product that is processed by using chemicals and unnatural preservatives. As defined by the United Nations, youth refers to the young people who fall in the age group of 15-24 years.The problem: ultra-processed foods and its impact on human and environmental wellbeing. The food processing industry is largely driven by profit-making objectives owing to the intense competition in the market. The manufacturers of food processing have to ensure that they don't lose out their customers to their competitors. To maintain their consumer base the manufacturers work to make their processed food desirable and attractive. In the process, they resort to the usage of such products that are unnatural and unhealthy for both the human body as well as the environment. Some of the examples of such ingredients include chemicals used for preserving, colouring, and adding texture and flavour to the natural food, refined carbohydrates, sweeteners, and processed vegetable oils.Due to the use of above-mentioned ingredients, the consumption of ultra-processed foods becomes harmful to the human body. It has been found out through research that their consumption does not add any nutritional value to the human body. Moreover, it becomes very difficult for the human body to digest ultra-processed foods. Some people become addicted to such food and it has been studied that some food products are more addictive than drugs. Apart from this, the intake of the ultra-processed foods increases the instances of several diseases such as heart ailments, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.Processed food also impacts the natural environment. The waste generated after the processing of the food and the handling of the waste affects the air, water and soil. The process of handling and packaging of the product results in the release of harmful chemicals and toxins in the environment. This not only affects the natural environment but also human health. The solution to this problem is to create awareness about the harmful effects of ultra-processed foods and to promote sustainable alternatives to it. The youth can play a very important role in spreading awareness about the ill-effects as well as the alternatives to the ultra-processed foods. The sample of our study is the young consumers of ultra-processed foods of the University of Delhi. This is because the youth is the largest consumer of the ultra-processed foods and they can work towards promoting more sustainable and healthy food choices and habits amongst people. The research questions are: 1) What are the different kinds of ultra-processed foods that are consumed by people? 2) How does the food processing industry work? 3) How can the youth be made aware about the ill-effects of ultra-processed foods? 4) What are the sustainable alternatives to ultra-processed foods? 5) What role youth can play in promoting sustainable alternatives? The hypothesis are: 1) Ultra-processed foods affect the environment and human well-being negatively. 2) The youth can play a positive role in promoting alternatives to ultra-processed foods.The research methodology, is the theoretical and empirical analysis of the study. The nudge theory would be applied to understand how alternatives can be promoted by the youth. Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein introduced the concept of nudging and defined a nudge as ``any aspect of the choice, architecture that predictably alters people's behaviour without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.'' It doesn't mean restricting the options available to the people but it means regulating their behaviour. The questionnaires and surveys to assess the consuming habits of the people and the use of pictorial and graphical representation of the data collected through the surveys and questionnaires are used. Despite the study focuses on the role of the youth, the surveys were conducted with youth as well as adults to make the study more inclusive and comprehensive.},

  abstract = {Raised blood pressure is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, responsible for 62\% of stroke and 49\% of coronary heart disease. There is overwhelming evidence that dietary salt is the major cause of raised blood pressure and that a reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure, thereby, reducing blood pressure-related diseases. Several lines of evidence including ecological, population, and prospective cohort studies, as well as outcome trials, demonstrate that a reduction in salt intake is related to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence also suggests that a high salt intake may directly increase the risk of stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, and renal disease; is associated with obesity through soft drink consumption; is related to renal stones and osteoporosis; is linked to the severity of asthma; and is probably a major cause of stomach cancer. In most developed countries, a reduction in salt intake can be achieved by a gradual and sustained reduction in the amount of salt added to foods by the food industry. In other countries where most of the salt consumed comes from salt added during cooking or from sauces, a public health campaign is needed to encourage consumers to use less salt. Several countries have already reduced salt intake. The challenge now is to spread this out to all other countries. A modest reduction in population salt intake worldwide will result in a major improvement in public health.},

In conducting this type of research, it is imperative to examine several different sources to determine where the knowledge overlaps and where it falls short. A literature review requires a synthesis of different subtopics to come to a greater understanding of the state of knowledge on a larger issue. It works very much like a jigsaw puzzle.

  abstract = {Sodium chloride is one of the most widely used additives in the food processing sector. Currently, the daily sodium intake is approximately three times the recommended daily allowance for an adult (in Ireland and UK) and processed meat products contribute to about 20\% of the total sodium dietary intake. The dietary concern about salt consumption has encouraged food industries to consider methods for lowering salt use. However, due to the essential functions (flavour, texture and shelf-life) provided by salt in meat products, the effects of using reduced amounts of salt must be carefully considered. In this review the numerous approaches for sodium reduction in processed foods are presented, highlighting: the reduction of salt level over time, the use of salt substitutes such as other metallic salts and the use of flavour enhancers such as monosodium glutamate or yeast extract. Novel technologies to assist the development of low sodium products, such as high pressure processing and power ultrasound are also introduced. Limitations for each method are discussed, with emphasis on the microbiological implications for the shelf-life stability of low-sodium products. Multiple challenges need to be addressed in order to improve the flavour perception and safety of sodium-reduced products. A combination of multiple tools could give the desired effect; in particular, novel technological treatments such as high hydrostatic pressure and ultrasound technology, seem to be promising to ensure microbiological safety in low-sodium meat products. \textbullet Lower salt concentration in processed meat products may impact quality parameters and shelf-life of the products.\textbullet Response to salt reduction is product-specific. Major constraints are given by consumer acceptance.\textbullet Lactates can effectively control bacterial growth but have negative consequences on flavour and texture of the products.\textbullet New processing technology can enhance salt uptake while ensuring microbiological safety.},

Relations between electrolyte excretion and blood pressure were studied in individual subjects within each centre and the results of these regression analyses pooled for all 52 centres. Relations between population median electrolyte values and population blood pressure values were also analysed across the 52 centres. Sodium excretion ranged from 0.2 mmol/24 h (Yanomamo Indians, Brazil) to 242 mmol/24 h (north China). In individual subjects (within centres) it was significantly related to blood pressure. Four centres found very low sodium excretion, low blood pressure, and little or no upward slope of blood pressure with age. Across the other 48 centres sodium was significantly related to the slope of blood pressure with age but not to median blood pressure or prevalence of high blood pressure. Potassium excretion was negatively correlated with blood pressure in individual subjects after adjustment for confounding variables. Across centres there was no consistent association. The relation of sodium to potassium ratio to blood pressure followed a pattern similar to that of sodium. Body mass index and heavy alcohol intake had strong, significant independent relations with blood pressure in individual subjects.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The surveyed community was Kyowa town (census population in 1985 = 16,792) where we have conducted a community-based blood pressure control program since 1981 and health education on reduction of salt intake since 1983 for primary prevention of hypertension. A 24-hour urine collection was conducted for systematically selected samples of the participants aged 40-69 in cardiovascular risk surveys in 1982-86 (early period) and in 1990-94 (later period) to estimate changes in urine excretion of sodium, potassium, and sodium/potassium ratio. RESULTS: A 24-hour urine collection was available for 565 persons (410 men and 155 women) in 1982-86 and 1,461 persons (571 men and 890 women) in 1990-94. A decline in mean sodium excretion was larger in ages 40-49 than in other age groups, and for ages 40-69 combined, the decline was 0.9-1.1 g per day for men and women. Mean sodium excretion declined to 10 g or less per day for men and women aged 60-69. Mean potassium excretion did not change except for men aged 60-69 with an increase in potassium. Sodium/potassium ratio tended to decline for women aged 40-49, and declined significantly for other sex-age groups. A larger reduction in sodium excretion was seen among persons with a history of hypertension compared to those without it. CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in urinary excretion of sodium and sodium/potassium ratio was observed in a community-based health education program. Men and women aged 60-69 reached a recommended level of 10 g or less in sodium intake.},

Results A total of 789 subjects were included in the total sample (mean age 58.83 {$\pm$} 6.58 years, 52.60\% men), a reliable FibroMax test was obtained from 714 subjects, 305 subjects were diagnosed with NAFLD. High consumption of UPF was associated with higher odds for metabolic syndrome (OR = 1.88, 95\% CI 1.31-2.71, P = .001) and its components; hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL, among the entire sample (OR = 1.53, 1.07-2.19, P = .026; OR = 1.51, 1.08-2.11, P = .017; OR = 1.55, 1.05-2.29, P = .028). In addition, it was associated with higher odds for NASH and hypertension (OR = 1.89, 1.07-3.38, P = .030; OR = 2.26, 1.20-4.26, P = .012 respectively) among subjects with NAFLD. Stratification by smoking status revealed an association between high UPF consumption and significant fibrosis among ever smokers in the entire sample and among subjects with NAFLD (OR = 1.89, 95\% CI 1.03-3.45, P = .039; OR = 2.85, 1.14-7.14, P = .026 respectively). Conclusions High UPF consumption is associated with metabolic syndrome in the general population, and among those with NAFLD it is associated with NASH marker. Ever-smoking may act synergistically with UPF to amplify the risk for fibrosis.},

  abstract = {Although we are increasingly reaping the benefits of qualitative studies, their approach and that of quantitative studies remain rather separate. Emergency medicine practitioners thrive off research in context as we deal with such an undifferentiated population however quantitative 'hard-science' work is conspicuous for its absence of positionality. This contrasts strongly with the way in which qualitative research, within the domain of so-called soft-science literature, uses positionality as an integral element of the research process. Without contextualising the researcher and research environment in qualitative studies, often the meaning of any research output is lost. What follows is that positionality does not undermine the truth of such research, instead it defines the boundaries within which the research was produced. The absence of positionality when considered alongside the notion of bias, may challenge the quantitative idea of validity.},

The monetary cost of diets was assessed in relation to whether or not they met eight food- and nutrient-based recommendations from SACN. Regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors. The primary outcome measure was individual dietary cost per day and per 2000 kcal (8368 kJ).SettingUK.SubjectsAdults (n 2045) sampled between 2008 and 2012 in the NDNS.ResultsOn an isoenergetic basis, diets that met the recommendations for fruit and vegetables, oily fish, non-milk extrinsic sugars, fat, saturated fat and salt were estimated to be between 3 and 17 \% more expensive. Diets meeting the recommendation for red and processed meats were 4 \% less expensive, while meeting the recommendation for fibre was cost-neutral. Meeting multiple targets was also associated with higher costs; on average, diets meeting six or more SACN recommendations were estimated to be 29 \% more costly than isoenergetic diets that met no recommendations.ConclusionsFood costs may be a population-level barrier limiting the adoption of dietary recommendations in the UK. Future research should focus on identifying systems- and individual-level strategies to enable consumers achieve dietary recommendations without increasing food costs. Such strategies may improve the uptake of healthy eating in the population.},

  abstract = {Trends in hypertension prevalence are difficult to assess because of a massive increase in the prevalence of antihypertensive treatment. Over the past three decades mean blood pressure levels among the 5209 members of the Framingham Study cohort have declined, and elevated blood pressure is only one third as prevalent. However, if those receiving treatment who have normalized blood pressures are defined as hypertensive, in addition to those with elevated blood pressure, the prevalence of hypertension has increased. No consistent secular trend in the incidence of hypertension was noted over three decades, but high blood pressure eventually developed in two thirds of the study cohort. To determine whether untreated blood pressure levels are changing over time, trends in mean blood pressure were examined in normotensive subjects over three decades. Only a 1 mm Hg decline in mean systolic and diastolic pressure over each 10-year interval was noted (p {$<$} 0.001). Thus blood pressure in the normotensive segment of the population has been quite stable. Because the incidence of hypertension is very high and future hypertension arises from the upper end of the normal blood pressure distribution, there is an urgent need for primary prevention. Preventive measures such as exercise, avoidance of salt and alcohol, and especially weight control deserve a high priority.},

  abstract = {Emerging evidence links several health outcomes to the consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF), but few studies have investigated the association between UPF intake and kidney function. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in relation to UPF intake in Korea. Data were obtained from the 2004-2013 Health Examinees (HEXA) study. The intake of UPF was assessed using a 106-item food frequency questionnaire and evaluated using the NOVA classification. The prevalence of CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of \textexclamdown 60 mL/min/m(2). Poisson regression models were used to compute the prevalence ratios (PR) of CKD according to quartiles of the proportion of UPF intake (\% food weight). A total of 134,544 (66.4\% women) with a mean age of 52.0 years and an eGFR of 92.7 mL/min/m(2) were analysed. The median proportion of UPF in the diet was 5.6\%. After adjusting for potential confounders, the highest quartile of UPF intake was associated with the highest prevalence of CKD (PR 1.16, 95\% CI 1.07-1.25), and every IQR (6.6\%) increase in the proportion of UPF in the diet was associated with a 6\% higher prevalence of CKD (PR 1.06, 95\% CI 1.03-1.09). Furthermore, the highest consumption of UPF was inversely associated with eGFR (Q4 vs. Q1: beta -1.07, 95\% CI -1.35, -0.79; per IQR increment: (beta -0.45, 95\% CI -0.58, -0.32). The intake of UPF was associated with a high prevalence of CKD and a reduced eGFR. Longitudinal studies in the Korean population are needed to corroborate existing findings in other populations.},

However, this may be difficult if people do not feel control over their environment and their personal circumstances. An important concept in relation to this is empowerment. Health professionals are expected to facilitate and enable people moving towards empowerment. In this paper, we address the question what is meant by individual empowerment. In an attempt to provide a theoretical framework, we discuss individual empowerment from a salutogenic perspective. This perspective introduces two fundamental concepts: the general resistance resources, and the sense of coherence. In addition, in order to further clarify and operationalise the concept, some factors influencing individual empowerment are identified, that is, locus of control, learned helplessness, self-efficacy and outcome expectations. These concepts find common ground in feelings of (lack of) control, but they differ in stability and changeability. We provide some suggestions how these factors can be influenced, and we discuss the meaning of the identified factors for empowering interactions between professionals and their clients. Health professionals can facilitate people to see a correspondence between their efforts and the outcomes thereof, improve and facilitate health literacy, in a relationship which can be characterised as partnership.},

Methods: This study included 12,849 eligible adults aged 20 years and over attending at least two surveys in the China Nutrition and Health Survey during 1997\textendash 2011. Food intake at each survey was assessed by a 3-day 24-h dietary recall method. UPF was defined based on the NOVA classification. Diabetes was obtained from questionnaires and/or ascertained by fasting blood tests. The association of diabetes with UPF was examined using mix effect logistic regression adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results: The mean age of the participants was 43.3 (SD 14.8) years. The age and gender adjusted mean UPF intake increased four times and the prevalence of diabetes increased eight times in 1997\textendash 2011. Compared with non-consumers, the odds ratios (95\% CI) of diabetes for those with mean UPF consumption of 1\textendash 19 g/day, 20\textendash 49 g/day, and {$\geq$}50 g/day were 1.21 (0.98, 1.48), 1.49 (1.19, 1.86), and 1.40 (1.08, 1.80), respectively (p trend {$<$} 0.001) after adjusted for the measured covariates including lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol drinking, and physical activity), BMI and hypertension. Conclusions: both UPF consumption and prevalence of diabetes increased among adults in China during 1997\textendash 2011. Higher UPF consumption was positively associated with diabetes.},

  abstract = {IntroductionThe consumption of the ultra-processed food has been associated with a growing prevalence of chronic diseases.ObjectiveTo assess the effect of processed food consumption on systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure among hypertensive patients.MethodsThis cross-sectional study enrolled 125 patients, aged 30\textendash 80 years, followed-up on the outpatient Hypertension Clinic from a reference Center (Hospital de Cl\'inicas de Porto Alegre), in southern Brazil. Food intake was assessed by 24-h dietary recall administered four times one week apart. Food items were aggregated by the types of processing into unprocessed (group 1), culinary foods (group 2), and ultra-processed foods (group 3). The intake was calculated by the number of items per group consumed daily and categorised in quartiles. Generalised Estimated Equation (GEE) was adopted in the analysis.ResultsThe consumption amount of unprocessed and culinary food was not associated with blood pressure. Among ultra-processed foods, the comparison between patients in the first and the forth quartile showed a difference of 15.8{$\pm$}4.0 mm Hg in SBP (p\textexclamdown 0.01) and 6.3{$\pm$}2.3 in DBP (p=0.02), controlled for age, gender and the consumption of both unprocessed and culinary food. No difference was observed for the 2nd and 3rd quartiles vs de 1st one.ConclusionThe ultra-processed foods consumption can affect SBP and DBP of hypertensive individuals.},

Therefore, we wanted to test whether theophylline can also improve impaired allograft function following ischemia reperfusion injury in experimental kidney transplantation (KT). Orthotopic transplantation of the left kidney was performed from Fisher 344 into Lewis rats. All transplanted rats received daily cyclosporine (5 mg/kg). The effect of theophylline treatment (10 mg/kg) on graft function was compared with appropriate controls on day 5 after KT by assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (inulin clearance). On day 5, GFR of allografts in control rats was 0.23 {$\pm$} 0.05 ml/min/g kidney weight (\emph{n} = 10) compared with 0.50 {$\pm$} 0.09 ml/min/g in rats receiving theophylline (\emph{n} = 9, \emph{p} \&lt; 0.01), representing a 2-fold increase in GFR. Renal AdoR A\textsubscript{1} mRNA content was significantly increased in both KT groups compared with their respective control groups, whereas mRNA of AdoR A\textsubscript{2a}, A\textsubscript{2b}, and A\textsubscript{3} were found to be unchanged. Theophylline did not affect significantly interstitial infiltration of the graft by monocytes/macrophages and T-cells. Likewise, serum cytokines [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}] and erythropoietin plasma levels were not different among the allograft groups. The present study demonstrates that theophylline remarkably improved early renal allograft function in rats undergoing KT without influencing cytokine serum patterns or tissue inflammation. Since theophylline is a commonly used medication in humans, clinical studies in patients undergoing KT are warranted.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Food items were classified according to the extent and purpose of industrial food processing. Ultra-processed foods (UPF) are formulations of many ingredients, mostly of exclusive industrial use, that result from a sequence of industrial processes (hence ultra-processed). Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) was defined according to the 2009 Joint Scientific Statement as meeting three or more of the following criteria: (1) elevated waist circumference (2) elevated fasting plasma glucose (3) elevated blood pressure (4) elevated triglycerides (5) reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C). Poisson regression models with robust variance adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, education, physical activity and smoking showed significant linear association between the dietary contribution of UPF and the prevalence of MetS (a 10\% increase in contribution was associated with a 4\% prevalence increase) (prevalence ratio -PR- = 1.04; 95\% CI 1.02, 1.07).

The association was stronger in young adults (PR between upper and lower quintiles = 1.94; 95\% CI 1.39, 2.72) and decreased with age.

UPF are defined by the NOVA classification as industrial food and drinks made from substances not used in domestic culinary preparations, such as hydrogenated fats, modified starches, and other food additives. There is evidence suggesting a link between UPF consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence, but this association has not been tested in a large European cohort. Using data from the pan-European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study, we assessed the hypothesis that higher consumption of UPF is associated with an increased risk of incident fatal and non-fatal CHD and stroke in the EPIC-Heart cohort. Methods: Case-cohort design nested in the EPIC cohort including 36,415 adults from Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Socio-demographic, lifestyle factors and usual dietary intake were assessed at time of recruitment (1992 - 2000) using country-specific validated questionnaires. Consumption of UPF was expressed in percentage of grams per day. CVD cases ascertainment varied across EPIC centres and included hospital admissions, linkage to registers, self-report and mortality data. Proportion of missing values ranged from 0.95\% for smoking status to 14.2\% for history of diabetes. We performed multiple imputation on all covariates with missing values. Cox proportional hazard models with age as the underlying time variable stratified by sex, centre and age were used to test the longitudinal association between UPF consumption and coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke incidence adjusted for confounders. We applied prentice weights to our cox proportional hazard models to account for the case-cohort design. Results: The mean contribution of UPF to the overall diet in grams was 14.2\% in men and 12.8\% in women. After a median follow-up time of 9.7 years, it was documented 11,973 non-fatal and 2,281 fatal CHD events, and 6,765 non-fatal and 899 fatal stroke events. In models adjusted for education, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, height, diabetes, high blood pressure, alcohol, energy, and sodium intake, and the Mediterranean diet score, each 10\% increase in the consumption of grams from UPF was associated with an increased risk of non-fatal CHD (HR 1.13, 95\%CI 1.02 - 1.26), fatal CHD (HR 1.33, 95\%CI 1.09 - 1.62) and fatal stroke (HR 1.40, 95\%CI 1.07 - 1.85), but not with non-fatal stroke (HR 1.11, 95\%CI 0.98 - 1.24). Complete-case analysis showed similar results. Conclusion: In this large prospective cross-European study we found that higher proportion of UPF in the diet was associated with an increased risk of non-fatal CHD and fatal CHD and stroke. These findings corroborate other large-scale cohort studies indicating that the increasing consumption of ultra-processed intake may contribute to higher CVD incidence.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to  describe ultra-processed food and drinks (UPFDs) consumption, and associations with intake of total sugar and dietary fibre, and high BMI in adults across Europe. Methods Using food consumption data collected by food records or 24-h dietary recalls available~from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database, the foods consumed were classified by the level of processing using the NOVA classification. Diet quality was assessed by data linkage to the Dutch food composition tables (NEVO) and years lived with disability for high BMI from the~Global Burden of Disease Study~2019. Bivariate groupings were carried out to explore associations of UPFDs consumption with population intake of sugar and dietary fibre, and BMI burden, visualised by scatterplots. Results The energy share from UPFDs varied markedly across the 22 European countries included, ranging from 14 to 44\%, being the lowest in Italy and Romania, while the highest in the UK and Sweden. An overall modest decrease (2\textendash 15\%) in UPFDs consumption is observed over time, except for Finland, Spain and the UK reporting increases (3\textendash 9\%). Fine bakery wares and soft drinks were most frequently ranked as the main contributor. Countries with a~higher sugar intake reported also a~higher energy share from UPFDs, as most clearly observed for UPF (r\,=\,0.57, p value\,=\,0.032 for men; and r\,=\,0.53, p value\,=\,0.061 for women). No associations with fibre intake or high BMI were observed. Conclusion Population-level UPFDs consumption substantially varied across Europe, although main contributors~are similar. UPFDs consumption was not observed to be associated with country-level burden of high BMI, despite being related to a~higher total sugar intake.

  abstract = {Background The UK introduced an ambitious national strategy to reduce population levels of salt intake in 2003. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of this strategy on salt intake in England, including potential effects on health inequalities. Methods Secondary analysis of data from the Health Survey for England. Our main outcome measure was trends in estimated daily salt intake from 2003\textendash 2007, as measured by spot urine. Secondary outcome measures were knowledge of government guidance and voluntary use of salt in food preparation over this time period. Results There were significant reductions in salt intake between 2003 and 2007 (-0.175grams per day per year, p{$<$}0.001). Intake decreased uniformly across all other groups but remained significantly higher in younger persons, men, ethnic minorities and lower social class groups and those without hypertension in 2007. Awareness of government guidance on salt use was lowest in those groups with the highest intake (semi-skilled manual v professional; 64.9\% v 71.0\% AOR 0.76 95\% CI 0.58\textendash 0.99). Self reported use of salt added at the table reduced significantly during the study period (56.5\% to 40.2\% p{$<$}0.001). Respondents from ethnic minority groups remained significantly more likely to add salt during cooking (white 42.8\%, black 74.1\%, south Asian 88.3\%) and those from lower social class groups (unskilled manual 46.6\%, professional 35.2\%) were more likely to add salt at the table. Conclusions The introduction a national salt reduction strategy was associated with uniform but modest reductions in salt intake in England, although it is not clear precisely which aspects of the strategy contributed to this. Knowledge of government guidance was lower and voluntary salt use and total salt intake was higher among occupational and ethnic groups at greatest risk of cardiovascular disease.},

This recommendation is supported by systematic reviews and meta-analyses of nationally representative dietary surveys and long-term cohort studies. These data show that increased intake of ultra-processed foods is associated with poor-quality diets and with increased morbidity and mortality from several chronic diseases. Various attributes of ultra-processed foods acting through known, plausible, or suggested physiologic and behavioral mechanisms relate them to ill health, and it is likely that different combinations of attributes and mechanisms affect different health outcomes. Although more research should be done to identify these mechanisms, existing evidence is sufficient to recommend the avoidance of ultra-processed foods to optimize health and policies to support and make feasible this recommendation.},

The use of this classification is illustrated by applying it to data collected in the Brazilian Household Budget Survey which was conducted in 2002/2003 through a probabilistic sample of 48,470 Brazilian households. The average daily food availability was 1,792 kcal/person being 42.5\% from group 1 (mostly rice and beans and meat and milk), 37.5\% from group 2 (mostly vegetable oils, sugar, and flours), and 20\% from group 3 (mostly breads, biscuits, sweets, soft drinks, and sausages). The share of group 3 foods increased with income, and represented almost one third of all calories in higher income households. The impact of the replacement of group 1 foods and group 2 ingredients by group 3 products on the overall quality of the diet, eating patterns and health is discussed.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the global food system and the worldwide rapid increase of obesity and related diseases is not yet well understood. A reason is that the full impact of industrialized food processing on dietary patterns, including the environments of eating and drinking, remains overlooked and underestimated. Many forms of food processing are beneficial. But what is identified and defined here as ultra-processing, a type of process that has become increasingly dominant, at first in high-income countries, and now in middle-income countries, creates attractive, hyper-palatable, cheap, ready-to-consume food products that are characteristically energy-dense, fatty, sugary or salty and generally obesogenic. In this study, the scale of change in purchase and sales of ultra-processed products is examined and the context and implications are discussed. Data come from 79 high- and middle-income countries, with special attention to Canada and Brazil. Results show that ultra-processed products dominate the food supplies of high-income countries, and that their consumption is now rapidly increasing in middle-income countries. It is proposed here that the main driving force now shaping the global food system is transnational food manufacturing, retailing and fast food service corporations whose businesses are based on very profitable, heavily promoted ultra-processed products, many in snack form.},

Three main groups are defined: unprocessed or minimally processed foods (group 1), processed culinary and food industry ingredients (group 2), and ultra-processed food products (group 3). The use of this classification is illustrated by applying it to data collected in the Brazilian Household Budget Survey which was conducted in 2002/2003 through a probabilistic sample of 48,470 Brazilian households. The average daily food availability was 1,792 kcal/person being 42.5\% from group 1 (mostly rice and beans and meat and milk), 37.5\% from group 2 (mostly vegetable oils, sugar, and flours), and 20\% from group 3 (mostly breads, biscuits, sweets, soft drinks, and sausages). The share of group 3 foods increased with income, and represented almost one third of all calories in higher income households. The impact of the replacement of group 1 foods and group 2 ingredients by group 3 products on the overall quality of the diet, eating patterns and health is discussed.},

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of the ultra-processed foods consumption and components of the metabolic syndrome in children from Celaya, Mexico. Methods: Clinical, quantitative, correlational, and transversal study in a sample of 30 children aged 6-12 years, from seven randomly selected primary schools in Celaya, Mexico; frequency of consumption of ultra-processed foods, anthropometry, glucose and lipid profile were measured. Results: Positive correlations were found between consumption of instant soups with waist circumference (R=0.36), abdominal contour (R=0.40), bicipital fold (R=0.38) and abdominal fold (R=0.46); ultra-processed food consumption was positively associated with abdominal fold (R=0.40). Consumption of soft and carbonated drinks was positively associated with hip circumference (R=0.39). Physical activity was positively associated with arm muscle area percentile (R=0.73). Concerning biochemical markers, there is correlation between glucose levels with consumption of fiber cereal (R=0.44), ice cream, snow and popsicles (R=0.46), hazelnut cream (R=0.40), margarine (R=0.40); cholesterol levels were directly associated with pastries and doughnuts (R=0. 43), cereal bars (R=0.46), sweetened flake cereal (R=0.38), hazelnut cream (R=0.42), margarine (R=0.42), corn syrup (R=0.37); triglyceride levels were associated with nuggets and fish sticks (R=0.39), chocolate (R=0.38), candy, and marshmallow sticks (R=0.38). Blood pressure was affected by consumption of soft and carbonated beverages (R=0.48). Conclusions: The consumption of ultra-processed foods is significantly associated with anthropometric measurements of fat mass and biochemicals; while physical activity may be regulating the consumption of these foods.},

Chronic non-communicable diseases correspond to the main cause of death in the world and have inadequate nutrition as one of its main modifiable risk factors, highlighting the excessive consumption of sodium and its association with cardiovascular diseases, mediated by blood pressure. This study evaluated the impact of different policy scenarios for reducing sodium consumption from processed and ultra-processed foods in the prevention of deaths due to cardiovascular outcomes in the adult population in Brazil. We used secondary data from public reports and databases of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) and population surveys. We analyzed the impacts, up to 2027, of three scenarios: maintenance of the current voluntary targets, and two mandatory scenarios, considering the lowest targets in the Americas and the lowest global targets. The Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) analyzed the deaths prevented or delayed from sodium consumption in such scenarios. In 2027, more than 72,000 deaths would be attributed to excess sodium; the voluntary goals would result in the prevention or postponement of up to 4,001 (95\% uncertainty intervals - 95\%UI: 1,611-6,563) deaths, while the mandatory scenarios would result in the prevention of 9,704 (95\%UI: 3,955-15,665) and 15,561 (95\%UI: 6,350-25,096) deaths from cardiovascular diseases, considering the lower regional and international targets, respectively. The findings suggest that the maintenance of voluntary targets has limited impact when compared to possible and more restrictive scenarios of reducing sodium content in processed and ultra-processed foods and reinforce the need to adopt measures with greater effectiveness in the country.},

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to determine whether household consumer panel food-purchasing data could be used to assess the sodium content of processed foods. Our further objectives were to estimate the mean sodium content of UK foods by category and undertake analyses weighted by food-purchasing volumes. DESIGN: Data were obtained for 21,108 British households between October 2008 and September 2009. Purchasing data (product description, product weight, annual purchases) and sodium values (mg/100 g) were collated for all food categories known to be major contributors to sodium intake. Unweighted and weighted mean sodium values were calculated. RESULTS: Data were available for 44,372 food products. The largest contributors to sodium purchases were table salt (23\%), processed meat (18\%), bread and bakery products (13\%), dairy products (12\%), and sauces and spreads (11\%). More than one-third of sodium purchased (37\%) was accounted for by 5 food categories: bacon, bread, milk, cheese, and sauces. For some food groups (bread and bakery, cereals and cereal products, processed meat), purchase-weighted means were 18-35\% higher than unweighted means, suggesting that market leaders have higher sodium contents than the category mean. CONCLUSION: The targeting of sodium reduction in a small number of food categories and focusing on products sold in the highest volumes could lead to large decreases in sodium available for consumption and therefore to gains in public health.},

Results A total of thirty-five menus (lunch, n 35; snacks, n 70) provided to 1-5-year-old children were collected from seven LDC centres. Proportions of foodstuffs classified as MP, PCI, P and ULP were 54, 10, 15 and 21 \%, respectively. All lunches were classified as MP. ULP foods accounted for 6 \% of morning snacks; 41 \% of afternoon snacks. Mean daily amount of Na provided per child across all centres was 633 (sd 151) mg. ULP foods provided 40 \% of Na, followed by P (35 \%), MP (23 \%) and PCI (2 \%). Conclusions Centres provided foods resulting in a mean total daily Na content that represented 63 \% of the recommended Upper Level of Intake for Na in this age group. A significant proportion of ULP snack foods were included, which were the major contributor to total daily Na intake. Replacement of ULP snack foods with MP lower-Na alternatives is recommended.},

The present study investigated the association between consumption of food according to the degree of processing and anthropometric indicators of obesity and blood pressure in children. This is a cross-sectional study with 164 children aged 7-10 years. The body mass index (BMI) for age, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was evaluated. Food consumption was analyzed by three 24-h dietary recalls, and classified as: G1-unprocessed or minimally processed; G2-culinary ingredients and processed food; and G3-ultra-processed food. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate the associations among variables. The average energy consumption was 1762.76 kcal/day, split into 45.42\%, 10.88\%, and 43.70\%, provided by G1, G2, and G3, respectively. Adjusted linear regression analyses identified that the caloric contribution of G1 was inversely associated with DBP, showing that for each 10\% increase in the energy intake of minimally processed foods, there was a reduction of 0.96 mmHg in the DBP (beta:-0.10; 95\% CI:-0.19 to -0.01; r(2) = 0.20). There was no association between the caloric contribution of food groups and BMI, WC, WHtR, and SBP. Increasing consumption of G1 could be a strategy for the prevention and treatment of hypertension in schoolchildren.},

Participants known to be hypertensive added more salt to their meals but consumed less salty ultra-processed foods. Waist circumference in both sexes and BMI were positively correlated with salt intake estimated by 24 h urinary Na excretion. In addition, regression analysis revealed that being a young male or having a high waist circumference was a predictor of higher salt intake. Conclusions Salt intake in this population was well above the recommended amount. The main source of salt intake came from salt added during cooking.

Systolic blood pressure variability measurements were made on 744 participants at the start of the trial. Systolic blood pressure variability was calculated over three time frames: 24 h, daytime and night-time. The placebo and active treatment subgroups were analysed separately using an intention-to-treat principle, adjusting for confounding factors using a multiple Cox regression model.         Participants~         An elderly hypertensive European population.         Main outcome measures~         Stroke, cardiac events (fatal and non-fatal heart failure, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and sudden death) and cardiovascular mortality (death attributed to stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, sudden death, pulmonary embolus, peripheral vascular disease and aortic dissection).         Results~         The risk of stroke increased by 80\% (95\% confidence interval: 17\textendash 176\%) for every 5 mmHg increase in night-time systolic blood pressure variability in the placebo group. Risk of cardiovascular mortality and cardiac events was not significantly altered. Daytime variability readings did not predict outcome.

  abstract = {We examined the association between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and adiposity in a nationally representative sample of the UK adult population. We studied 6,143 participants (19 to 96 years, 51.6\% female) sampled by the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008\textendash 16). Food items reported in four-day food diary were classified according to the NOVA system. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations between the dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods (sex-specific quartile and continuous) and Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC) and obesity (BMI{$>$}30kg/m2) and abdominal obesity (men: WC{$\geq$}102cm, women: WC{$\geq$}88cm) status. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. In multivariable analyses, the highest consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with 1.66 kg/m2 higher BMI (95\%CI 0.96\textendash 2.36), 3.56 cm greater WC (95\%CI 1.79\textendash 5.33) and 90\% higher odds for being obese (OR = 1.90, 95\%CI 1.39\textendash 2.61), compared with the lowest consumption. A 10\% increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with an increase of 0.38 kg/m2 in BMI (95\%CI 0.20\textendash 0.55), 0.87 cm in WC (95\%CI 0.40\textendash 1.33) and 18\% higher odds of being obese (OR = 1.18, 95\%CI 1.08\textendash 1.28). The consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with an increase in BMI, WC and prevalence of obesity in both sexes. A dose response relationship was observed in both sexes, with a 10\% increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods being associated with a 18\% increase in the prevalence of obesity in men and a 17\% increase in women. Higher consumption of ultra-processed food is associated with greater adiposity in the UK adult population. Policy makers should consider actions that promote consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods and reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods.},

  abstract = {Objectives To describe dietary sources of free sugars in different age groups of the UK population considering food groups classified according to the NOVA system and to estimate the proportion of excessive free sugars that could potentially be avoided by reducing consumption of their main sources. Design and setting Cross-sectional data from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008\textendash 2014) were analysed. Food items collected using a 4-day food diary were classified according to the NOVA system. Participants 9364 individuals aged 1.5 years and above. Main outcome measures Average dietary content of free sugars and proportion of individuals consuming more than 10\% of total energy from free sugars. Data analysis Poisson regression was used to estimate the associations between each of the NOVA food group and intake of free sugars. We estimated the per cent reduction in prevalence of excessive free sugar intake from eliminating ultra-processed foods and table sugar. Analyses were stratified by age group and adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, survey year, region and equivalised household income (sterling pounds). Results Ultra-processed foods account for 56.8\% of total energy intake and 64.7\% of total free sugars in the UK diet. Free sugars represent 12.4\% of total energy intake, and 61.3\% of the sample exceeded the recommended limit of 10\% energy from free sugars. This percentage was higher among children (74.9\%) and adolescents (82.9\%). Prevalence of excessive free sugar intake increased linearly across quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption for all age groups, except among the elderly. Eliminating ultra-processed foods could potentially reduce the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake by 47\%. Conclusion Our findings suggest that actions to reduce the ultra-processed food consumption generally rich in free sugars could lead to substantial public health benefits.},

Design: Longitudinal study in which food consumption was evaluated according to the percentage contribution of daily energetic intake (\%/d) of each NOVA classification group (unprocessed/minimally processed foods and culinary preparations (U/MPF \& CP); processed foods and ultra-processed foods (UPF)). Hypertension was defined according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) criteria. Adjusted relative risks (RR) and their 95\% confidence intervals (95 \% CI) were estimated by Poisson regression models with robust variances. Setting: Brazil. Participants: 1221 graduates classified as non-hypertensive at baseline and monitored for 2 years. Results: Daily energetic percentage from each group according to degree of processing was 64 center dot 3 (sd 12) \% for U/MPF \& CP; 9 center dot 9 (sd 5 center dot 8) \% for processed foods and 25 center dot 8 (sd 11) \% for UPF. Incidence of hypertension was high (152/1000 person-years; n 113, 193/1000 person-years in males and n 257, 138/1000 person-years in females). After adjusting for potential confounders, participants in the upper quintile of daily energetic intake of U/MPF\&CP presented a reduced risk of hypertension (RR: 0 center dot 72; 95 \% CI 0 center dot 52, 0 center dot 98), while those in the upper quintile of daily energetic intake of UPF presented an increased risk of the outcome (RR: 1 center dot 35; 95 \% CI 1 center dot 01, 1 center dot 81). Conclusions: In this prospective cohort of Brazilian middle-aged adult university graduates, the highest consumptions of U/MPF\&CP and UPF were associated with, respectively, reduced and increased risk of hypertension. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our results.},

Current research is primarily based on non-US study populations. The purpose of our study was to estimate the association between UPF consumption and risk of incident hypertension in a population of middle-aged black and white men and women. Methods: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants who were hypertension free at baseline and had complete dietary, covariate, and hypertension data from visit 1 (1987 - 1989) were included (n = 8,866). Participants were followed through November 30, 2019 for the development of hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure [greater than or equal] 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure [greater than or equal] 90 mmHg, or recent patient-reported use of blood pressure lowering medication. Processing level was determined using the NOVA classification system. Data were analyzed using three progressively adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: 6,960 participants developed hypertension during a median follow-up of 13 years. Participants in the highest quartile of UPF consumption were 9\% more likely to develop incident hypertension than those in the lowest quartile (model 2 HR: 1.09; CI: 1.02-1.16; P for trend = 0.01) (Table). Participants who were in the highest quartile of sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meat consumption had a 20\% higher risk of hypertension (model 2 HR, 1.20; CI, 1.12 - 1.28; P for trend {$<$}0.001) and 9\% higher risk of hypertension (model 2 HR, 1.09; CI, 1.02 - 1.17; P for trend {$<$}0.001), respectively, when compared to the lowest quartile. Participants in the highest quartile of minimally or unprocessed food consumption had 9\% lower incidence of hypertension (model 2 HR, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.85 - 0.97; P for trend 0.01). Conclusions: High UPF consumption, specifically sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meat, was associated with higher risk of hypertension, whereas minimally or unprocessed food consumption was associated with lower hypertension risk.},

Nutri-Score is a front-of-pack labelling system adopted by several European countries. This system ranks foods according to their nutritional quality, but does not consider other dimensions such as the degree of food processing. The aim of this study is to compare the nutritional quality (as assessed by Nutri-Score) and the ultra-processing (as assessed by the NOVA classification) of foods in the Open Food Facts database. A simple correspondence analysis was carried out to study the relationship between the two systems. Ultra-processed foods (NOVA 4) were found in all Nutri-Score categories, ranging from 26.08\% in nutritional category A, 51.48\% in category B, 59.09\% in category C, 67.39\% in category D to up to 83.69\% in nutritional category E. Given the negative effect that the consumption of ultra-processed foods has on different aspects of health, front-of-pack labelling with Nutri-Score should at least be accompanied by complementary labelling indicating the level of processing, such as the NOVA classification.},

METHOD: Two independent evaluators analyzed the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science and Lilacs until December 2018. We used the following terms: (convenience foods OR food processing OR highly-processed OR industrialized foods OR minimally-processed OR prepared foods OR processed foods OR ultra-processed OR ultraprocessed OR ultra processed OR unprocessed) AND (metabolic syndrome OR hypertension OR blood pressure OR diabetes mellitus OR glucose OR glycaemia OR insulin OR cholesterol OR triglycerides OR blood lipids OR overweight OR obesity) AND (adult OR adults OR adulthood OR aged OR elderly OR old). We assessed methodological and evidence qualities, and also extracted information for the qualitative synthesis from the selected studies. RESULTS: Of the 6,423 studies identified after removing duplicates, eleven met the eligibility criteria. The main food classification we used was Nova. The consumption of ultra-processed foods was positively associated with overweight and obesity, high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome. All articles included met more than 50\% of the methodological quality criteria. The quality of evidence was considered moderate for the outcome overweight and obesity and weak for hypertension and metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The Nova food classification stands out in the area of nutritional epidemiology when assessing the effects of food processing on health outcomes. Although caution is required in the interpretation, the results indicated that the consumption of ultra-processed foods can have an unfavorable impact in the health of individuals.},

I addressed these aims in three studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 prospective cohort studies, an ecological, longitudinal cross-country comparison, and a prospective analysis in the UK EPIC-Norfolk cohort. The research presented in this dissertation revealed consistent associations between UPFs and adverse cardiometabolic health.},

However, little is known about the association between UPF consumption and blood pressure (BP). Thus, this study examined the association between UPF consumption and elevated BP in Korean adults. METHODS: This study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016-2018) and included 9,188 participants aged 30-79 years without a history of hypertension diagnosis. Food items reported in a one-day 24-hour recall were categorized on the basis of the NOVA (not an acronym) food classification criteria. UPF consumption was estimated as the contribution to total energy intake. Elevated BP was defined as systolic BP {$\geq$}120 mmHg or diastolic BP {$\geq$}80 mmHg. The independent association between UPF consumption and elevated BP was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The upper tertile of UPF consumption was significantly associated with elevated BP compared with the lower tertile, after adjusting for potential confounders. A linear trend was observed for elevated BP across the tertiles of the dietary energy contribution of UPF. Similar results were found in stratified analyses by age group, smoking, obesity, and overall dietary quality. However, a marginal level of association was found in some subgroups, current smokers, and non-obese adults. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary energy contribution of UPF consumption was positively associated with increased prevalence of elevated BP, and these findings suggest that lowering UPF consumption might help prevent BP elevation.},

  abstract = {Consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF) replaces the intake of freshly prepared unprocessed/minimally processed food (MPF) and is positively associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective of this observational study was to investigate the relation between (1) UPF and (2) MPF with peripheral and central blood pressure (BP), wave reflection, and arterial stiffness. Habitual dietary intake, ambulatory BP, augmentation index (AIx), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed in 40 normotensive young adults (15 M/25 W; 27 +/- 1 y; body mass index 23.6 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2)). UPF consumption was positively associated with overall and daytime peripheral systolic BP (B = 0.25, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.03, 0.46, p = 0.029; B = 0.32, 95\% CI 0.09, 0.56, p = 0.008, respectively), daytime diastolic BP (B = 0.18, 95\% CI 0.01, 0.36, p = 0.049) and daytime peripheral pulse pressure (PP; B = 0.22, 95\% CI 0.03, 0.41, p = 0.027). MPF consumption was inversely associated with daytime peripheral PP (B = -0.27, 95\% CI -0.47, -0.07, p = 0.011), overall and daytime central systolic BP (B = -0.27, 95\% CI -0.51, -0.02, p = 0.035; B = -0.31, 95\% CI -0.58, -0.04, p = 0.024, respectively), and nighttime central PP (B = -0.10, 95\% CI -0.19, -0.01, p = 0.042). Both UPF and MPF were not associated with AIx nor PWV. These data suggest avoidance of UPF and consumption of more MPF may reduce CVD risk factors.},

  abstract = {Differing hypertension prevalence rates between certain population and age groups are partially due to differences in the intake of certain nutrients. Blood pressure is positively associated with higher sodium, alcohol, and protein intakes; it is inversely associated with potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes. Salt may lead to an increase in blood pressure in the presence of salt sensitivity, but there is no inexpensive or easy strategy to identify salt-sensitive patients. Other risk factors for hypertension include obesity and lack of regular physical activity. The best strategy appears to be moderate salt restriction (6\textendash 7 g/day) in combination with an optimal compliance of the antihypertensive drug therapy, as well as adoption of the combination diet of the DASH study\textemdash a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and thus rich in potassium. Current evidence does not support the increased intake of Ca2+ or Mg2+ for blood-pressure-lowering purposes only; however, calcium and magnesium may represent important components in the combination diet of the DASH study. It seems that it is the combination of these nutrients that is of crucial importance for the achievement of optimal blood-pressure reduction. Also recommended is a decrease in alcohol consumption and an increase in regular physical activity. Instead of a severe intervention with regard to 1 risk factor alone, positive changes in 5 habits combined\textemdash high salt intake, high sodium-to-potassium ratio, alcohol intake, calorie imbalance, and a sedentary life\textemdash may be the most realistic and effective strategy to counteract the present hypertension epidemic.},

Setting: Adolescents assisted by the Family Doctor Program (FDP) in Niteroi, a metropolitan area in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Subjects: Survey of 210 adolescents. Individuals with three or more of the following components of MetS were classified as having this syndrome: TAG \textquestiondown = 110 mg/dl; HDL cholesterol \textexclamdown{} 50 mg/dl for girls aged 12-19 years and boys aged 12-14 years or \textexclamdown 45 mg/dl for boys aged 15-19 years; waist circumference \textquestiondown = 75th percentile; serum glucose \textquestiondown 100 mg/dl; and blood pressure a \textquestiondown = 90th percentile. A semi-quantitative FFQ was used, and foods were grouped as: unprocessed or minimally processed foods (Group 1), processed culinary and food industry ingredients (Group 2) and ultra-processed foods (Group 3). The associations between food consumption and MetS were adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioural and family history covariates and were estimated using generalized estimation equations with the Poisson regression model. Results: MetS was diagnosed in 6.7\% of the adolescents; the most frequent diagnostic criteria included the reduction of HDL cholesterol (46.7\%) elevated serum glucose (17.1\%) and the elevation of waist circumference (16.7\%). Crude analysis showed higher average daily intakes of energy, carbohydrates and ultra-processed foods among adolescents with MetS. After statistical adjustment, the intake of ultra-processed foods (\textquestiondown = 3rd quartile) remained associated with MetS (prevalence ratio = 2.5; P = 0.012). Conclusions: High consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with the prevalence of MetS in this adolescents group.},

It was aimed to investigate the possible associations of dietary patterns (DPs) with SAD in adults having multiple CVD risk factors. Design: Dietary intake was evaluated through two 24-h dietary recalls and principal component analysis was used to identify DPs. Oscillometry, applanation tonometry with pulse wave analysis and carotid ultrasound were used to assess peripheral and aortic BP, arterial stiffness and pressure wave reflections. Setting: Laiko University Hospital, Athens, Greece. Participants: A total of 470 individuals (53 center dot 1 +/- 14 center dot 2 years) with CVD risk factors were enrolled. Results: A pattern characterised by increased consumption of whole-grain cereals, white meat and reduced consumption of sugar was positively associated with common carotid compliance (beta = 0 center dot 01, 95 \% CI 0 center dot 00, 0 center dot 01), whereas a pattern high in refined cereals, red and processed meat was positively associated with brachial but not aortic systolic pressure (beta = 1 center dot 76, 95 \% CI 0 center dot 11, 3 center dot 42) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (beta = 1 center dot 18, 95 \% CI 0 center dot 02, -2 center dot 38). Low consumption of low-fat dairy products, high consumption of full-fat cheese and butter was positively associated with MAP (beta = 0 center dot 97, 95 \% CI 0 center dot 01, 1 center dot 95). Increased consumption of vegetables, fruits, fresh juices, fish and seafood was inversely associated with augmentation index (AIx) (beta = -1 center dot 01, 95 \% CI -1 center dot 93, -0 center dot 09). Conclusion: Consumption of whole grains, white meat, fruits/vegetables, fish/seafood and avoidance of sugar was associated with improved SAD. Preference in refined grains, red/processed meat, high-fat cheese/butter and low intake of low-fat dairy products were associated with BP elevation. Future studies are needed to confirm the present findings.},

The aim of this study was to describe the dietary intake and contribution of sodium and potassium to the Mexican diet, and to describe its association with nutrition status and clinical characteristics. We analyzed a national survey with 4219 participants. Dietary information was obtained with a 24-h recall. Foods and beverages were classified according to level of processing. The mean intake (mg/d) of Na was 1512 in preschool children, 2844 in school-age children, 3743 in adolescents, and 3132 in adults. The mean intake (mg/d) of K was 1616 in preschool children, 2256 in school-age children, 2967 in adolescents, and 3401 in adults. Processed and ultra-processed foods (UPF) contribute 49\% of Na intake in preschool children, 50\% in school-age children, 47\% in adolescents, and 39\% in adults. Adults with high Na intake had lower serum concentrations of cholesterol, HDL-c, and LDL-c. A significant proportion of the Mexican population has a high intake of Na (64-82\%) and low K (58-73\%). Strategies to reduce Na and increase K intake need to reduce the possibility of having high BP and serum lipid disturbances.},

  abstract = {Ultra-processed foods (UPF) consumption has increased greatly over the last decades but its impact on health remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the prospective effect of different degrees of food processing on children's cardiometabolic profile. Children from the Portuguese population-based birth cohort Generation XXI evaluated at 7 and 10 years of age (y), with dietary information at 7 y and anthropometric measurements at 10 y, were included in the present study (n = 3034). Dietary data were collected by 3-day food diaries and all reported food items were classified according to the degree of processing using the NOVA classification system. The daily consumption of the NOVA classification groups was calculated (in grams, as a proportion of total grams and total energy intake). The cardiometabolic outcomes included were serum markers [fasting glucose, insulin, blood lipids], anthropometric measurements [body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC)], body composition [fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM)] and blood pressure (BP). Age- and sex-specific sample z-scores were obtained for all outcomes. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify a potential cluster of cardiovascular risk factors. Generalized linear models were fitted to evaluate the association between the consumption according to the processing degree (as absolute gram intake) and the individual cardiometabolic risk factors and cluster, adjusted for child's sex, maternal age and education and remaining NOVA groups. A mediation role of children's BMI in the previous analysis were tested. At 7 y, the daily median consumption of un/minimally processed, processed and UPF was 1210 g, 113 g and 433 g (68\%, 6\% and 25\% of the total grams, as well as 51\%, 15\% and 31\% of the total energy intake, respectively). After adjustment, an increase of 100 g in the consumption of un/minimally processed at 7 y was associated with a lower BMI ({$\beta$}\textasciicircum{} = -0.028; 95\%CI: -0.043; -0.014), WC ({$\beta$}\textasciicircum{} = -0.020; 95\%CI: -0.032; -0.008), FM ({$\beta$}\textasciicircum{} = -0.023; 95\%CI: -0.035; -0.011), insulin ({$\beta$}\textasciicircum{} = -0.022; 95\%CI: -0.036; -0.008) and BP (systolic BP: {$\beta$}\textasciicircum{} = -0.014; 95\%CI: -0.025;-0.004; diastolic BP: {$\beta$}\textasciicircum{} = -0.013; 95\%CI: -0.020;-0.005), at 10 y. BMI was a mediator between the consumption of un/minimally processed foods and BP. Positive associations were found between consumption of processed foods and the cluster `higher blood pressure', while an inverse association was described between un/minimally processed and the cluster 'higher blood pressure'. No significant associations were found between the UPF consumption and any cardiometabolic outcomes. High consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods has a favourable effect on later children's cardiometabolic health, namely lower body weight and body fat, lower waist circumference, blood pressure insulin serum levels.},

  abstract = {The eruption of genetic research presents a tremendous opportunity to epidemiologists to improve our ability to identify causes of ill health. Epidemiologists have enthusiastically embraced the new tools of genomics and proteomics to investigate gene-environment interactions. We argue that neither the full import nor limitations of such studies can be appreciated without clarifying underlying theoretical models of interaction, etiologic fraction, and the fundamental concept of causality. We therefore explore different models of causality in the epidemiology of disease arising out of genes, environments, and the interplay between environments and genes. We begin from Rothman's "pie" model of necessary and sufficient causes, and then discuss newer approaches, which provide additional insights into multifactorial causal processes. These include directed acyclic graphs and structural equation models. Caution is urged in the application of two essential and closely related concepts found in many studies: interaction (effect modification) and the etiologic or attributable fraction. We review these concepts and present four important limitations., 1. Interaction is a fundamental characteristic of any causal process involving a series of probabilistic steps, and not a second-order phenomenon identified after first accounting for "main effects"., 2. Standard methods of assessing interaction do not adequately consider the life course, and the temporal dynamics through which an individual's sufficient cause is completed. Different individuals may be at different stages of development along the path to disease, but this is not usually measurable. Thus, for example, acquired susceptibility in children can be an important source of variation., 3. A distinction must be made between individual-based and population-level models. Most epidemiologic discussions of causality fail to make this distinction., 4. At the population level, there is additional uncertainty in quantifying interaction and assigning etiologic fractions to different necessary causes because of ignorance about the components of the sufficient cause.},

  abstract = {Objective To examine the association between consumption of ultra-processed foods and risk of colorectal cancer among men and women from three large prospective cohorts. Design Prospective cohort study with dietary intake assessed every four years using food frequency questionnaires. Setting Three large US cohorts. Participants Men (n= 46 341) from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2014) and women (n=159 907) from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2014; n=67 425) and the Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2015; n=92 482) with valid dietary intake measurement and no cancer diagnosis at baseline. Main outcome measure Association between ultra-processed food consumption and risk of colorectal cancer, estimated using time varying Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors. Results 3216 cases of colorectal cancer (men, n=1294; women, n=1922) were documented during the 24-28 years of follow-up. Compared with those in the lowest fifth of ultra-processed food consumption, men in the highest fifth of consumption had a 29\% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for highest versus lowest fifth 1.29, 95\% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.53; P for trend=0.01), and the positive association was limited to distal colon cancer (72\% increased risk; hazard ratio 1.72, 1.24 to 2.37; P for trend{$<$}0.001). These associations remained significant after further adjustment for body mass index or indicators of nutritional quality of the diet (that is, western dietary pattern or dietary quality score). No association was observed between overall ultra-processed food consumption and risk of colorectal cancer among women. Among subgroups of ultra-processed foods, higher consumption of meat/poultry/seafood based ready-to-eat products (hazard ratio for highest versus lowest fifth 1.44, 1.20 to 1.73; P for trend{$<$}0.001) and sugar sweetened beverages (1.21, 1.01 to 1.44; P for trend=0.013) among men and ready-to-eat/heat mixed dishes among women (1.17, 1.01 to 1.36; P for trend=0.02) was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer; yogurt and dairy based desserts were negatively associated with the risk of colorectal cancer among women (hazard ratio 0.83, 0.71 to 0.97; P for trend=0.002). Conclusions In the three large prospective cohorts, high consumption of total ultra-processed foods in men and certain subgroups of ultra-processed foods in men and women was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Further studies are needed to better understand the potential attributes of ultra-processed foods that contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The childhood obesity rate has been steadily rising among US youths during the past 2 decades. Increasing evidence links consumption of ultraprocessed foods to excessive calorie consumption and weight gain, but trends in the consumption of ultraprocessed foods among US youths have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To characterize trends in the consumption of ultraprocessed foods among US youths. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Serial cross-sectional analysis using 24-hour dietary recall data from a nationally representative sample of US youths aged 2-19 years (n\,=\,33\,795) from 10 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999-2000 to 2017-2018. EXPOSURES: Secular time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of total energy consumed from ultraprocessed foods as defined by NOVA, an established food classification system that categorizes food according to the degree of food processing. RESULTS: Dietary intake from youths were analyzed (weighted mean age, 10.7 years; 49.1\% were girls). From 1999 to 2018, the estimated percentage of total energy from consumption of ultraprocessed foods increased from 61.4\% to 67.0\% (difference, 5.6\% [95\% CI, 3.5\% to 7.7\%]; P\,{$<$}\,.001 for trend), whereas the percentage of total energy from consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods decreased from 28.8\% to 23.5\% (difference, -5.3\% [95\% CI, -7.5\% to -3.2\%]; P\,{$<$}\,.001 for trend). Among the subgroups of ultraprocessed foods, the estimated percentage of energy from consumption of ready-to-heat and -eat mixed dishes increased from 2.2\% to 11.2\% (difference, 8.9\% [95\% CI, 7.7\% to 10.2\%]) and from consumption of sweet snacks and sweets increased from 10.7\% to 12.9\% (difference, 2.3\% [95\% CI, 1.0\% to 3.6\%]), but the estimated percentage of energy decreased for sugar-sweetened beverages from 10.8\% to 5.3\% (difference, -5.5\% [95\% CI, -6.5\% to -4.5\%]) and for processed fats and oils, condiments, and sauces from 7.1\% to 4.0\% (difference, -3.1\% [95\% CI, -3.7\% to -2.6\%]) (all P\,{$<$}\,.05 for trend). There was a significantly larger increase in the estimated percentage of energy from consumption of ultraprocessed foods among non-Hispanic Black youths (from 62.2\% to 72.5\%; difference, 10.3\% [95\% CI, 6.8\% to 13.8\%]) and Mexican American youths (from 55.8\% to 63.5\%; difference, 7.6\% [95\% CI, 4.4\% to 10.9\%]) than the increase among non-Hispanic White youths (from 63.4\% to 68.6\%; difference, 5.2\% [95\% CI, 2.1\% to 8.3\%]) (P\,=\,.04 for trends). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on the NHANES cycles from 1999 to 2018, the estimated proportion of energy intake from consumption of ultraprocessed foods has increased among youths in the US and has consistently comprised the majority of their total energy intake.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Processed foods are major contributors to population dietary salt intake. Parts of the Australian food industry have started to decrease salt in a number of products. A definitive baseline assessment of current sodium concentrations in foods is key to targeting reformulation strategies and monitoring progress. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to systematically collate data on the sodium content of Australian processed food products and compare sodium values against maximum target levels established by the UK Food Standards Agency (UK FSA). DESIGN: Categories of processed foods that contribute the majority of salt to Australian diets were identified. Food-composition data were sought for all products in these categories, and the sodium content in mg/100 g (or mg/100 mL for liquids) was recorded for each. Mean sodium values were calculated for each grouping and compared with the UK FSA benchmarks. RESULTS: Sodium data were collected for 7221 products in 10 food groups, 33 food categories, and 90 food subcategories. The food groups that were highest in sodium were sauces and spreads (1283 mg/100 g) and processed meats (846 mg/100 g). Cereal and cereal products (206 mg/100 g) and fruit and vegetables (211 mg/100 g) were the lowest in sodium. Sixty-three percent of food categories had mean sodium concentrations above the UK FSA targets, and most had wide ranges between the most and least salty product. CONCLUSIONS: Many products, particularly breads, processed meats, and sauces, have salt amounts above reasonable benchmarks. The variation in salt concentrations between comparable products suggests that reformulation is highly feasible for many foods.},

These products constitute a large and increasing amount of the food supply in high and middle-income countries. Accumulating evidence point to an association of UPF intake with increased mortality and adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, whether UPF consumption is associated with cognitive function is not clear. We investigated the associations between UPF intake and cognitive decline, in a cohort of older adults at high-risk for dementia due to type-2 diabetes (T2D). Method The study sample included initially non-demented T2D older adults ({$\geq$}65y), from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline (IDCD) study, who had complete information on nutrition at baseline and at least three cognitive assessments (mean follow-up 5.3{$\pm$}1.5y). Nutritional intake was evaluated by a validated Food-Frequency Questionnaire and foods were categorized as UPF based on NOVA classification. Percent of calories from UPF were calculated from total caloric consumption, first as overall UPF intake and then for specific food groups. Global cognitive functioning and four cognitive domains (episodic memory, working memory/attention, semantic categorization, and executive functions) were assessed. Mixed effect models were used to examine the link between UPF intake (top vs. bottom quartiles) and change in cognitive function while adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking, physical activity, BMI, HbA1C, duration of diabetes, total cholesterol and blood pressure. Result Of the total sample (N=578; mean age at baseline 71.3{$\pm$}4.5y, 61\% men), 144 (top quartile) consumed \textquestiondown 31\% kcal from UPF out of total kcal. Total UPF consumption was not related to cognitive function. However, consumption of ultra-processed fat (e.g. mayonnaise) was associated with faster decline in global cognition, executive function and memory (\ss =-0.028{$\pm$}0.010; p=0.009, \ss =-0.031{$\pm$}0.014; p=0.022 and \ss =-0.035{$\pm$}0.017; p=0.046, respectively). Additionally, increased intake of ultra-processed meat (e.g. sausages) was associated with a faster decline in executive functions (\ss =-0.029{$\pm$}0.013; p=0.031). UPF derived from dairy products and carbohydrates were not associated with cognitive change. Conclusion This pioneering study suggests a possible association of ultra-processed meat and fat intake with accelerated cognitive decline in older individuals with T2D, independently of sociodemographic, lifestyle, cardiovascular and T2D-related factors.},

  abstract = {Background/objectives Little is known about time trends in diet quality and associated inequalities in the UK. This study aimed to examine trends in adherence to four UK dietary recommendations, overall and among sociodemographic subgroups, from 1986 to 2012. Subjects/methods We conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis using data from three UK diet surveys: Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults 1986\textendash 87 (n = 2018), National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) 2000\textendash 01 (n = 1683) and NDNS Rolling Programme 2008\textendash 12 (n = 1632). We measured adherence to dietary recommendations for fruit and vegetables, salt, oily fish, and red and processed meat, estimated using food diary record data. We compared adherence across surveys and by four sociodemographic characteristics: sex, age, socioeconomic position and ethnicity. Results Overall, population adherence to dietary recommendations was low to moderate, but improved over time. There were inequalities in adherence to all recommendations at all timepoints according to one or more sociodemographic characteristic. When inequalities were present, women, older adults, those with non-manual occupations and non-Whites were more likely to adhere to dietary recommendations. Although some dietary inequalities declined, most persisted across the three surveys. Conclusions The persistence of most inequalities highlights the need for further interventions to reduce dietary inequalities as well as improve overall population diet. The greatest simultaneous improvement in population adherence and reduction of inequalities was observed for salt, which may reflect the success of the UK Salt Reduction Programme. Similarly comprehensive programmes should be encouraged for other dietary components.},
