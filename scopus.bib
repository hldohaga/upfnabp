abstract={Background: There have been reports of isolated trace elements or vitamin deficiencies due to imbalanced diets, but no cases of selenium deficiency combined with scurvy have been reported. Case presentation: A 7 year-old boy diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and mild psychomotor retardation, started an imbalanced diet including specific snacks and lacto-fermenting drinks from 5 years of age. Gingival hemorrhage and perioral erosions occurred at 6 years and 8 months of age, and he was referred to our hospital at 7 years of age. Slight tachycardia was found. Serum vitamin C level was 1.1 µg/dL (reference range (rr): 5–17.5 µg/dL), and selenium level was 2.8 µg/dL (rr: 7.7–14.8 µg/dL). He was diagnosed with both selenium deficiency and scurvy. Multivitamins and sodium selenate were administered for 12 days during admission, and symptoms of selenium deficiency and scurvy improved. After discharge, symptoms abated following the administration of multivitamins and regular administration of sodium selenate every 3 months. Conclusions: We report a complicated case of both selenium deficiency and scurvy due to an imbalanced diet of snacks and lacto-fermenting drinks in a 7-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder. In patients with imbalanced diet, regular blood tests including trace elements and vitamins are necessary. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: High salt intake is a major cause of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The out-of-home sectors have been identified as one of the contributors of high salt intake in the population. The National Salt Reduction Policy of Malaysia was initiated in 2015; however, out-of-home sectors are yet to be emphasized and perception by policy-makers and the food industries towards salt reduction are yet unknown. This study aimed to determine the perceptions, barriers and enablers towards salt reduction in the out-of-home sector in Malaysia, as well as among policy-makers and the food industries. Methods: This is a qualitative study via semi-structured in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD) involving several stakeholders consisting of policy-makers from five ministries, five nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and food science/food technology researchers from five regions (West, North, East, and South Peninsular and East Malaysia/Borneo), as well as the food industries. The IDI and FGD sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using Nvivo software version 12. Results: All participants agreed that salt intake in Malaysia is high and leads to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Lack of awareness, poor eating culture and behaviour and frequent eating out were among the causes of high salt intake. Awareness campaigns and education, sodium content labelling and product reformulation were strategies that have been implemented by the government; whilst for the food industries, some of them have tried to reduce salt and labelled the sodium content on their food products. However, there were several barriers including perceived poor consumer acceptance, lack of knowledge and resources, and challenges in reformulation, as well as unavailability of guidelines and salt targets. Hence, several enablers have been suggested, which include prioritizing the salt reduction strategy, creating more awareness, collaboration and engagement, research and technology particularly for reformulation and shelf-life stability, incentives and salt tax. Conclusions: Salt reduction efforts of the out-of-home sector in Malaysia could be achieved through several measures or enablers that can overcome the barriers currently faced by stakeholders, especially policy-makers, food industries and the consumers themselves. This study will benefit the policy-makers to improve the salt reduction policy of out-of-home sectors and highlight the concerns among the food industries on the policy. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: We aimed to assess potential associations of habitual dietary pattern scores in relation to the risk of pre-diabetes (Pre-DM) progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or the chance of returning to normal glycemia. Methods: This cohort study included 334 Pre-DM individuals (mean age of 49.4 years, and 51.5% men) who participated in the third phase of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (2006–2008) and followed up for a median of 9 years. A validated food frequency questionnaire at baseline assessed usual intakes of the participants. Major dietary patterns were identified using principal component analysis. The DASH score and Mediterranean diet score (MDS) were also calculated. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of developing T2DM and returning to normal glycemia in relation to dietary pattern scores. Results: During the study follow-up, 39.8% progressed to T2DM, and 39.8% returned to normal glycemia. Three following major dietary patterns, including Western-style (with a higher load of red meats, hydrogenated fats, sodium, and total fat intakes), healthy pattern (with a higher load of whole grains, vegetables, and dairy products), and processed-foods pattern (with a higher load of processed-meats, fast-foods, salty snakes, and sweets and candies) were identified. The Western-style dietary pattern increased the risk of progressing to T2DM by 38% (OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.89, P = 0.050). Other dietary pattern scores were not related to regression or progression from Pre-DM. Conclusion: The Western-style dietary pattern (characterized by higher load of red meats, hydrogenated fats, sodium intake, and high-GI foods) may accelerate the progression of Pre-DM to T2DM. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Globally, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common diseases, and the incidence is gradually increasing. Diet management could improve the elevated HbA1c levels. Aim: This review aims to examine the effects of different types of diets on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Methods: PubMed and Google scholar databases were searched. Reports published from the years 1991 to 2021 that focused on the effect of different diets on diabetes control were selected. Results: All the studies reported that the type of diet can affect insulin secretion and glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The recommended macronutrient distribution for patients with diabetes is 30% of fat, 45–60% of carbohydrates, and 15–35% of protein. Consuming more or less of these macronutrients may lead to changes in glucose metabolism and may affect insulin secretion. In fact, following alow-fat diet improves glycemic control and decreases HbA1c levels. Studies reported that a low-carbohydrate diet had the greatest effect on improving glycemic control and insulin parameters. A low-calorie diet reduced fasting plasma glucose, while a very low-calorie diet resulted in a long-term decrease in HbA1c level. A healthy diet free of processed foods and sugar, and rich in nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals contributed to maintaining controlled blood sugar and lipid plasma levels. Although studies show a low-salt diet improves blood pressure, which is common inT2DM, other findings show that restricting salt intake is associated with increased sugar consumption. Conclusion: Healthy diet with adequate intake of energy and low-fat and low-sugar foods can enhance the glycemic control and reduce T2DM complications. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Objective: To explore and describe the associations between provider encouragement and four sodium consumption behaviors. Methods: We analyzed a 2016 Internet panel survey dataset of 954 socio-demographically diverse adults (age ≥18 years) living in Los Angeles County. Behaviors analyzed were current status of watching one's salt/sodium intake, frequency of adding salt to food, frequency of using a food/Nutrition Facts label to decide what food to purchase, and frequency of changing one's mind about buying a food product due to its sodium content. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined the relationship between doctor/health professional (provider) encouragement and these sodium-related behaviors, controlling for self-reported health status and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Provider encouragement was positively associated with three of the four sodium consumption behaviors examined: currently watching salt/sodium intake (AOR=7.27, 95% CI=3.97–13.34); frequently using a food/Nutrition Facts label (AOR=1.70, 95% CI=1.09–2.64); and frequently changing one's mind about buying a food product due to its sodium content (AOR=2.29, 95% CI=1.45–3.63). Conclusions: Provider encouragement appears to have a salutary impact on sodium consumption among residents. Practice implications: Provider encouragement may represent an underutilized strategy for counseling patients about cardiovascular health and about the benefits of reducing sodium consumption. © 2023 The Authors},

abstract={Compared with an omnivorous Western diet, plant-based diets containing mostly fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, with restricted amounts of foods of animal origin, are associated with reduced risk and severity of COVID-19. Additionally, inflammatory immune responses and severe acute respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, including pulmonary oedema, shortness of breath, fever and nasopharyngeal infections, are associated with Na toxicity from excessive dietary Na. High dietary Na is also associated with increased risks of diseases and conditions that are co-morbid with COVID-19, including chronic kidney disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes and obesity. This article presents evidence that low dietary Na potentially mediates the association of plant-based diets with COVID-19 prevention. Processed meats and poultry injected with sodium chloride contribute considerable amounts of dietary Na in the Western diet, and the avoidance or reduction of these and other processed foods in whole-food plant-based (WFPB) diets could help lower overall dietary Na intake. Moreover, high amounts of K in plant-based diets increase urinary Na excretion, and preagricultural diets high in plant-based foods were estimated to contain much lower ratios of dietary Na to K compared with modern diets. Further research should investigate low Na in WFPB diets for protection against COVID-19 and co-morbid conditions. © The Author(s), 2022.

abstract={Background: Gulf War Illness is a multi-symptom condition affecting veterans of the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War, which often presents with comorbid hypertension. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of the low glutamate diet, as well as an acute challenge of monosodium glutamate (MSG)/placebo, on resting heart rate, blood oxygenation level, and blood pressure (BP) in this population. Methods: These data were measured at 4 time points: baseline, after 1 month on the low glutamate diet, and during each challenge week, where subjects were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover challenge with MSG/placebo over 3 days each week. Pre-post diet changes were analyzed using paired t tests, change in the percentage of veterans meeting the criteria for hypertension was compared using chi-square or Fisher exact tests, and crossover challenge results were analyzed using general linear modeling in SAS®9.4. Results: There was a significant reduction in systolic BP (sitting and recumbent; both P &lt; .001) and diastolic BP (sitting; P = .02) after 1 month on the diet. The percentage meeting the criteria for hypertension was also significantly reduced (P &lt; .05). Challenge with MSG/placebo did not demonstrate an acute effect of glutamate on blood pressure. Conclusion: Overall, these findings suggest that the low glutamate diet may be an effective treatment for lowering blood pressure in veterans with Gulf War Illness. This dietary effect does not appear to be driven by reduced consumption of free glutamate, but rather, by an increase in consumption of non-processed foods. © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To analyze the factors associated with self-reported arterial hypertension, as well as its prevalence in the Brazilian adult population. METHODS: Data from 88,531 individuals aged 18 years or older who responded to the 2019 National Health Survey were analyzed. The outcome studied was self-reported arterial hypertension. Sociodemographic variables and clinical and lifestyle conditions were considered as exposures. The prevalence ratio (PR), crude and adjusted for sex, age, and schooling was used as a measure of association to verify the factors related to its prevalence, obtained by Poisson regression with robust variance. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported arterial hypertension was of 23.9% (95%CI: 23.4-24.4). When adjusting for age, sex, and schooling, the adjusted Prevalence Ratios (APR) were higher among: regular health self-assessment (APR = 1.6; 95%CI: 1.5-1.6) and bad health self-assessment (APR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.6-1.8); self-reference to heart disease (APR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.6-1.7), diabetes (APR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.6-1.8), high cholesterol (APR = 1.6; 95%CI: 1.6-1.7), overweight (APR = 1.4; 95%CI: 1.4-1.5), and obesity (APR = 2.0; 95%CI: 1.9-2.1); high salt intake (APR = 1.1; 95%CI: 1.0-1.1); higher among former smokers (APR = 1.1; 95%CI: 1.1-1.2) and lower among smokers (APR = 0.9; 95%CI: 0.8-0.9); and consumption of ultra-processed foods (APR = 0.9; 95%CI: 0.8-0.9). CONCLUSION: A quarter of the Brazilian adult population claims to have arterial hypertension, more prevalent among women and associated with older age groups, Black, mixed-race, and others, low schooling, high salt intake, former smoking, presence of comorbidities, and worse health self-assessment.},

abstract={Epidemiological trends have led to a growing consensus that diet plays a central role in the etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A Western diet high in ultra-processed foods has been associated with an increased prevalence of IBD worldwide. Much attention has focused on components of the Western diet, including the high fat content, lack of fiber, added sugars, and use of additives, such as carrageenan and other emulsifiers. Less attention has been paid to the impact of high salt intake, an integral component of ultra-processed foods, which has increased dramatically in the US diet over the past 50 years. We review a growing body of literature linking the rise in dietary salt intake with the epidemiology of IBD, increased consumption of salt as a component of ultra-processed foods, high salt intake and imbalances in immune homeostasis, the effects of a high-salt diet on other inflammatory disorders, salt's impact on animal colitis models, salt as an underrecognized component in diet modification-induced remission of IBD, and directions for future investigation. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Objective: A study was undertaken to determine the perceptions of key role-players regarding challenges and opportunities to move the South African salt-reduction strategy forward. Design: The study had a qualitative, exploratory design using in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Setting: South Africa. Subjects: A total of 12 participants from various fields within the salt-reduction strategy environment, including academia, government and policy-related institutions, research sector and non-governmental organisations, took part. Outcome measures: Consumer knowledge, consumer education programmes, multi-sectoral collaboration, research efforts and strategy recommendations were noted. Results: Overall perceptions of the current salt-reduction strategy in South Africa were positive. Most of the participants agreed that the current strategy is the best approach to reduce the salt intake of the South African population. Participants strongly believed, however, that the strategy is not currently reinforced and that the initial momentum is lost. Concerns were raised regarding the absence of consumer-awareness campaigns, the population’s lack of knowledge regarding salt intake and its relation to health, and the challenges around the monitoring of salt/sodium in processed foods. Participants also highlighted the lack of current studies in this field as well as existing data to be used for baseline studies. Conclusions: South Africa’s current salt-reduction strategy is the correct approach to decrease the population’s salt intake. The initial phase of implementing the strategy has been successful, but the current perception is that government is not following through with this strategy. Several key areas that are needed for this strategy to succeed are being neglected. © 2022 The Author(s). Co-published by NISC Pty (Ltd) and Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Ischemic stroke is by far the most common type of cerebrovascular event and remains a major cause of death and disability globally. Despite advancements in acute stroke care, primary prevention is still the most cost-effective approach in reducing the burden of ischemic stroke. The two main strategies for primary stroke prevention include population-wide versus high-risk group interventions. Interventions such as increasing access to primary care, regulation of salt and sugar contents in processed foods, public education, and campaigns to control cerebrovascular risk factors are examples of population-wide interventions. High-risk group interventions, on the other hand, focus on recognition of individuals at risk and aim to modify risk factors in a timely and multifaceted manner. This article provides an overview on conventional modifiable risk factors for ischemic stroke and highlights the emerging risk factors and approaches for high-risk group identification and treatment. © 2022 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

abstract={Purpose: Mental health and sleep quality are associated with genetics and nutrient and energy intake. The present study examined the association between ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and genetic risk score (GRS) and their interactions on mental health and sleep quality in Iranian women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 278 overweight and obese females aged between 18 and 56 years. According to the NOVA classification system, 37 food groups and beverages were collected using a 147-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The blood parameters of all participants were assessed. Mini-column kit (type G; Genall; Exgene) and the PCR–RFLP method were used to extract DNA and determine gene polymorphism, respectively. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including Caveolin_1 (Cav_1), Melanocortin4 receptor (MC4R), and cryptochrome circadian regulator 1 (CRY1), were used to calculate GRS. The individual risk allele (0, 1, 2) for each SNP was calculated using the incremental genetic model. Results: After controlling for confounders, a significant interaction was found for depression (β = 0.026, 95% CI 0.003, 0.049, P = 0.028) and depression anxiety stress scales (DASS) score (β = 0.059, 95% CI 0.001, 0.117, P = 0.046) on the NOVA classification system and GRS. Conclusions: The findings of this study showed a significant interaction between GRS and the NOVA classification system on mental disorders, including depression, DASS score and stress. There was also a significant relationship between the NOVA classification system and anxiety, DASS score, sleep quality and depression. Furthermore, a partially significant association was observed between GRS and stress.

abstract={Nocardiosis is a rare, life-threatening opportunistic infection caused by bacteria in the environment that predominantly affects immunocompromised patients. Nocardiosis most commonly involves the lungs but can disseminate to other organs. Disseminated nocardiosis, defined as Nocardia infection involving 2 or more organ systems, requires early detection and treatment because of high morbidity and mortality. We report 2 cases of disseminated nocardiosis with pulmonary and central nervous system involvement in kidney transplant recipients. Nocardiosis should be suspected in immunocompromised patients with fever and lung mass, although atypical presentations involving almost any organ can be seen. Solid organ transplant recipients are at greatest risk for Nocardia infection within the first 1 to 2 years after transplantation. However, the patients presented here developed disseminated nocardiosis several years after transplantation, which has important implications. Nocardiosis is treated with 2 to 6 weeks of empiric induction antibiotics, followed by 6 to 12 months of maintenance antibiotics based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Objective This study examines the impact of a salt reduction campaign on knowledge, attitudes, intentions, behaviours and barriers to behaviour change relating to salt consumption in two provinces of China. Methods In 2019, the 'Love with Less Salt' campaign ran on China Central Television and on local television channels in Shandong and Anhui provinces. Data for this study come from two representative household surveys conducted among a sample of adults aged 25-65 years in Shandong and Anhui provinces: precampaign (n=2000) and postcampaign (n=2015). Logistic regression was performed to estimate the effects of the campaign on knowledge, attitudes, intentions, behaviours and barriers to behaviour change. Results Overall, 13% of postcampaign respondents recalled seeing the campaign, and reactions towards the campaign were positive. Postcampaign respondents were more likely to plan to reduce their purchase of foods high in salt than precampaign respondents (OR=1.45, p=<0.05). Campaign-aware respondents were significantly more likely than campaign-unaware respondents to report higher levels of knowledge, attitudes and behaviours regarding salt reduction. Conclusions Findings reveal that salt reduction mass media campaigns can be an effective public health tool to support efforts to reduce salt consumption in China. Continued and sustained mass media investments are likely to be effective in addressing high salt consumption nationwide. ©},

abstract={Objectives Sales of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) and beverages are rising in low-income and middle-income countries. Such foods are often linked with weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension - diseases that are on the rise in India. This paper analysed patterns in purchases of processed and UPF by urban Indian households. Setting Panel data from Kantar- Worldpanel Division, India for 2013 and 2016. Participants 58 878 urban Indian households. Methods We used K-mean partition clustering and multivariate regression to analyse patterns in processed food (PF) and UPF purchase for urban India. Results Three-quarters of urban Indian households purchased over ten PF groups. Mean per person annual PF purchase was 150 kg. UPF purchase was low at 6.4 kg in 2016 but had grown by 6% since 2013. Cluster analysis identified three patterns of consumption, characterised by low (54% of the households in 2016), medium (36%) and high (10%) PF purchase quantities. High cluster households purchased over three times as much PFs and UPF as the low cluster households. Notably, salt purchases were persistently high across clusters in both years (>3.3 kg), while sweet snack and ready-to-eat food purchases grew consistently in all clusters between 2013 and 2016. A positive and significant association was found between household purchases of UPF and their socioeconomic status as well as ownership of durables, such as refrigerator, colour television and washing machine (all p<0.001). Spatial characteristics including size of town (p<0.05) in which the household is located were also positively associated with the purchase of UPF. Conclusion Results suggest the need for tailored regional and city level interventions to curb the low but growing purchase of UPF. New data on obesity and rise of non-communicable diseases, the results are concerning given the links between lifestyle changes and the speed of urbanisation in Indian cities. © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

abstract={Background: High dietary sodium intake is a leading cause of hypertension. A major source of dietary sodium is salt added to processed food products available in retail food environments. The fast-growing online grocery shopping setting provides new opportunities for salt reduction interventions that support consumers in choosing healthier options. Methods: The SaltSwitch Online Grocery Shopping randomized controlled trial is investigating the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a novel intervention for lowering salt consumption and blood pressure amongst people with hypertension who shop for groceries online. The intervention is based on a bespoke web browser extension that interfaces with a major retailer's online store to highlight and interpret product sodium content and suggest similar but lower-sodium alternatives. The primary outcome of interest is change in mean systolic blood pressure between individuals randomized (1:1) to the intervention and control (usual online shopping) arms at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes are diastolic blood pressure, spot urinary sodium and sodium:potassium ratio, sodium purchases, and dietary intake. Intervention implementation and lessons for future uptake will be assessed using a mixed methods process evaluation. Participants with hypertension who shop online for groceries and exhibit high sodium purchasing behavior are being recruited across Australia. A target sample size of 1,966 provides 80% power (2-sided alpha = 0.05) to detect a 2 mm Hg difference in systolic blood pressure between groups, assuming a 15 mm Hg standard deviation, after allowing for a 10% dropout rate. Discussion: This trial will provide evidence on an innovative intervention to potentially reduce salt intake and blood pressure in people with hypertension. The intervention caters to individual preferences by encouraging sustainable switches to similar but lower-salt products. If effective, the intervention will be readily scalable at low cost by interfacing with existing online retail environments. © 2022},

abstract={Background: Approximately one-third of adults in Trinidad and Tobago have high blood pressure (hypertension). Excessive consumption of sodium (Na+) is a known risk factor for hypertension. Aim: We investigated Na+ and potassium (K+) intakes and their correlates in a multi-ethnic Caribbean population. Method: Volunteers completed a self-administered questionnaire comprising socio-demographic items, physical activity (PA) and a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Foods eaten were classified by level of processing using the NOVA classification system and analysed for Na+ and K+ levels using appropriate dietary analysis software. The study was approved by the University of the West Indies at Saint Augustine Ethics Committee. Results: 11,783 adults participated in the study. Approximately 83.2% of total calories, 79% of Na+ and 40% of K+ was derived from the consumption of highly processed foods. Median daily Na+ and K+ intakes were 2759 mg and 2853 mg, respectively. Na+ intakes showed significant nonlinear increases with age (p &lt; 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) (p &lt; 0.001), and non-linear decreases with educational attainment (p &lt; 0.001). K+ intakes showed significant nonlinear decreases with age (p &lt; 0.001) and BMI (p &lt; 0.001), and linear increases with educational attainment (p &lt; 0.001). Males had higher intakes of Na+ and K+ than females. Na+: K+ was lower among persons participating in moderate to high intensity PA ≥ 150 minutes/week compared to those participating in such activities &lt; 150 minutes/week. Conclusion: Socio-demographic factors were significantly correlated with Na+ and K+ intakes among participants and must be considered in strategies aimed at achieving healthy intakes of these nutrients. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Background: Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet enhances potassium intake and reduces sodium intake and blood pressure (BP), but the underlying metabolic pathways are unclear. Objectives: Among free-living populations, we delineated metabolic signatures associated with the DASH diet adherence, 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretions, and the potential metabolic pathways involved. Methods: We used 24-hour urinary metabolic profiling by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize the metabolic signatures associated with the DASH dietary pattern score (DASH score) and 24-hour excretion of sodium and potassium among participants in the United States (n = 2164) and United Kingdom (n = 496) enrolled in the International Study of Macro- and Micronutrients and Blood Pressure (INTERMAP). Multiple linear regression and cross-tabulation analyses were used to investigate the DASH-BP relation and its modulation by sodium and potassium. Potential pathways associated with DASH adherence, sodium and potassium excretion, and BP were identified using mediation analyses and metabolic reaction networks. Results: Adherence to the DASH diet was associated with urinary potassium excretion (correlation coefficient, r = 0.42; P < 0.0001). In multivariable regression analyses, a 5-point higher DASH score (range, 7 to 35) was associated with a lower systolic BP by 1.35 mmHg (95% CI, -1.95 to -0.80 mmHg; P = 1.2 × 10-5); control of the model for potassium but not sodium attenuated the DASH-BP relation. Two common metabolites (hippurate and citrate) mediated the potassium-BP and DASH-BP relationships, while 5 metabolites (succinate, alanine, S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide, 4-hydroxyhippurate, and phenylacetylglutamine) were found to be specific to the DASH-BP relation. Conclusions: Greater adherence to the DASH diet is associated with lower BP and higher potassium intake across levels of sodium intake. The DASH diet recommends greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and other potassium-rich foods that may replace sodium-rich processed foods and thereby influence BP through overlapping metabolic pathways. Possible DASH-specific pathways are speculated but confirmation requires further study. INTERMAP is registered as NCT00005271 at www.clinicaltrials.gov. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Hypertension (HTN) is a leading modifiable risk factor for multiple diseases. It has reached epidemic proportions, affecting nearly a third of the world's population. With such a high prevalence and an exhaustive list of potential complications, antihypertensive therapy has been a subject of focus for the scientific community for a long time. Recently, Dietary fiber is emerging as yet another promising candidate addressing this issue. It is a well-known fact that dietary modification alone can significantly impact a patient's health, with a noticeable effect on BP as well. But simply switching to healthy alternatives is not enough and must happen in tandem with dietary supplementation. The consumption of ultra-processed food has only increased in recent times. Hence, we feel the need to focus on dietary interventions in managing hypertension. This review aims to bring to light the current literature on the pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatment protocols of hypertension, focusing on dietary fibers and their role in hypertension management. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) have a 6-fold higher risk of mortality than age- and sex-matched controls. Whether high consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with survival in RTRs is unknown. Objectives: We aimed to study the association between high consumption of ultra-processed foods and all-cause mortality in stable RTRs. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in adult RTRs with a stable graft. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated 177-item FFQ. Food items were categorized according to the NOVA classification system and the proportion ultra-processed foods comprised of total food weight per day was calculated. Results: We included 632 stable RTRs (mean ± SD age: 53.0 ± 12.7 y, 57% men). Mean ± SD consumption of ultra-processed foods was 721 ± 341 g/d (28% of total weight of food intake), whereas the intake of unprocessed and minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, and processed foods accounted for 57%, 1%, and 14%, respectively. During median follow-up of 5.4 y [IQR: 4.9-6.0 y], 129 (20%) RTRs died. In Cox regression analyses, ultra-processed foods were associated with all-cause mortality (HR per doubling of percentage of total weight: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.46, 3.10; P < 0.001), independently of potential confounders. This association was independent from the quality of the overall dietary pattern, expressed by the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. When analyzing ultra-processed foods by groups, only sugar-sweetened beverages (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.39; P = 0.007), desserts (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.49; P = 0.03), and processed meats (HR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.86; P = 0.004) were associated with all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Consumption of ultra-processed foods, in particular sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and processed meats, is associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality after renal transplantation, independently of low adherence to high-quality dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Purpose: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and type-2 diabetes. The study aimed to establish the efficacy of a community-based lifestyle intervention on MetS in Kenyan adults using randomized control trial involving a 15-months follow up. Methods: A randomized controlled trial involving 352 (18–64 years old) adults with MetS spanning 15-months duration. Participants were recruited from a Nairobi based Mission-led outpatient clinic, randomly assigned equally into intervention and control groups. The intervention group was exposed to a community-based health education on lifestyle modification, while control group was subjected to hospital-led routine care involving treatment and general lifestyle advice. The study was structured into baseline, intervention and evaluation phases with inbuilt data collection in each phase. Physiologic, anthropometric, and clinical parameters as well lifestyle characteristics were measured at baseline, midline and end-line. The parameters were compared across the groups and between the time points during analyses using chi-square test, binary logistic, independent t-test and paired t-test. Results: Proportion of participants with MetS declined significantly (p < 0.001) with marked (p < 0.05) improvement in markers of MetS (elevated BP, raised sugars, cholesterols, central obesity) in intervention compared to control group. The rates of consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and uptake of physical activity significantly (p < 0.05) improved in the intervention group. However, the intake of processed/fast foods, salt, sugar, and alcohol significantly (p < 0.05) declined in the intervention compared to controls by the end-line. Conclusion: One in three adults under the community-based lifestyle intervention had improvement in physiologic, anthropometrics and clinical markers relevant to definition of MetS. Additionally, an improved adherence to the recommended dietary intake and increased uptake of physical activity in adults with MetS was observed. These findings underscore the feasibility, effectiveness and proof of concept for community-based lifestyle approach as a viable strategic intervention for addressing premorbid risk factors for cardiovascular CVDs and diabetes before evolving into full blown conditions in low-income settings. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Intake of salt is a biological imperative, inextricably woven into physiological systems, human societies and global culture. However, excessive salt intake is associated with high blood pressure. As this effect likely drives cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, excessive salt intake is estimated to cause ~5 million deaths per annum worldwide. Animal research has identified various mechanisms by which high salt intake drives disease in the kidney, brain, vasculature and immune system. The potential for therapeutic interventions in many of these pathways has yet to be tested. Salt-reduction interventions lower blood pressure, but for most individuals, ‘hidden’ salt in processed foods disconnects salt intake from discretionary control. This problem is compounded by growing inequalities in food systems, which form another hurdle to sustaining individual dietary control of salt intake. The most effective salt-reduction interventions have been implemented at the population level and comprise multi-component approaches, involving government, education and the food industry. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={High-salt diets are a major cause of hypertension and cardiovascular (CV) disease. Many governments are interested in using food salt reduction programs to reduce the risk for salt-induced increases in blood pressure and CV events. It is assumed that reducing the salt concentration of processed foods will substantially reduce mean salt intake in the general population. However, contrary to expectations, reducing the sodium density of nearly all foods consumed in England by 21% had little or no effect on salt intake in the general population. This may be due to the fact that in England, as in other countries including the U.S.A., mean salt intake is already close to the lower normal physiologic limit for mean salt intake of free-living populations. Thus, mechanism-based strategies for preventing salt-induced increases in blood pressure that do not solely depend on reducing salt intake merit attention. It is now recognized that the initiation of salt-induced increases in blood pressure often involves a combination of normal increases in sodium balance, blood volume and cardiac output together with abnormal vascular resistance responses to increased salt intake. Therefore, preventing either the normal increases in sodium balance and cardiac output, or the abnormal vascular resistance responses to salt, can prevent salt-induced increases in blood pressure. Suboptimal nutrient intake is a common cause of the hemodynamic disturbances mediating salt-induced hypertension. Accordingly, efforts to identify and correct the nutrient deficiencies that promote salt sensitivity hold promise for decreasing population risk of salt-induced hypertension without requiring reductions in salt intake. © 2022 The Author(s).},

High sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure and increased risk of developing CVD. International organizations suggest consuming <2 g of sodium/day; however, the Mexican population consumes amounts above what is recommended: 3.1 g/day. Although efforts have been made to mitigate this problem, interventions are needed to improve cardiovascular health. This policy brief offers a short review of the current sodium consumption situation in Mexico and the importance of why decision makers should consider actions to reduce consumption. Recommendations to reduce sodium/salt intake include: Reformulation of ultra-processed-foods, promote the use warning labels, communication campaign, reduce the use of table salt, and monitor sodium intake.

abstract={With its colonial past, and a glaring problem of poverty and hunger, India oft fails to acknowledge a new, rapidly growing problem of overnutrition. With the economic boost and entry of various foreign players from the food industry, Indian citizens have been increasingly exposed to ultra-processed, high in sugar, salt and fat foods (HFSS foods). The last decade or so has seen an exponential rise in the consumption of such foods, leading to increasing prevalence of overweight- and obesity-related illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, etc. In this scenario, examining the efficacy of policy-related measures in reducing consumption of these harmful foods and preventing the associated health issues is paramount. Across the globe, several countries have explored options from taxation on HFSS foods to restricting marketing to children, as well as different practices for front of the pack labeling. In the context of India and its increasing burden of preventable, diet-related illnesses, the urgent need of instituting these preventive policies at national scale cannot be neglected. © 2022, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.},

It is crucial to create a healthy food environment, including food systems that supply diversified, balanced, and healthy food options. Improving the food environment is a population approach. Radical population approaches necessitate removing the underlying impediments, such as high sodium prod-ucts, sugar-sweetened beverages, and unhealthy ultra-processed foods. Negotiation and collaboration with the private sector is critical to tackle and solve these issues. In Japan, public-private-academic collaboration has been implemented since 2013 in the national health promotion action, termed Health Japan 21 (Second term).

abstract={Objectives: to analyze the ultra-processed foods (UPF) consumption in pregnant women’s diets associated with nutrient intake. Methods: a cross-sectional study using socioeconomic, anthropometric and food consumption data from low-risk pregnant women. Consumption of energy, macro and micronutrient were obtained through two 24-hour recalls (R24h). The UPF were identified using the NOVA classification, and the percentage of energy from this food was classified in quartiles and associated with nutrient intake. So, the ANCOVA test adjusted for age and per capita income were adopted. Results: a total of 60 pregnant women with a mean of age of 28.44 (CI95%=27.20-29.69) years old were evaluated. The average percentage of UPF in the diet was 20.68 (CI95%=17.88-23.47). Pregnant women in the highest quartile of UPF consumption had lower protein intake (13.48g vs. 18.84g; p=0.031) and lower zinc intake (4.52mg vs. 6.18mg; p=0.045) when compared to those in the lowest quartile. Conclusions: the results showed a negative relationship between the participation of UPF in pregnant women’s diets and the intake of protein and zinc, important nutrients for the gestational period. Such findings reinforce the importance of promoting healthy eating habits during pregnancy to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients in this phase. © 2022, Instituto Materno Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira.

abstract={Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is a common treatment used in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases, owing to its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. However, GC therapy can also induce a number of adverse effects, including muscle and bone loss, hypertension, metabolic perturbations and increased visceral adiposity. We review available evidence in this area and provide nutritional recommendations that might ameliorate these adverse effects. Briefly, optimizing calcium, vitamin D, sodium and protein intake and increasing consumption of unprocessed and minimally processed foods, while decreasing the consumption of ultra-processed foods, might counteract some of the specific challenges faced by these patients. Importantly, we identify a dearth of empirical data on how nutritional intervention might impact health-related outcomes in this population. Further research is required to investigate the clinical and therapeutic efficacy of these theory-based recommendations. © 2022 The Author(s).},

abstract={Chronic non-communicable diseases correspond to the main cause of death in the world and have inadequate nutrition as one of its main modifiable risk factors, highlighting the excessive consumption of sodium and its association with cardiovascular diseases, mediated by blood pressure. This study evaluated the impact of different policy scenarios for reducing sodium consumption from processed and ultra-processed foods in the prevention of deaths due to cardiovascular outcomes in the adult population in Brazil. We used secondary data from public reports and databases of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) and population surveys. We analyzed the impacts, up to 2027, of three scenarios: maintenance of the current voluntary targets, and two mandatory scenarios, considering the lowest targets in the Americas and the lowest global targets. The Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) analyzed the deaths prevented or delayed from sodium consumption in such scenarios. In 2027, more than 72,000 deaths would be attributed to excess sodium; the voluntary goals would result in the prevention or postponement of up to 4,001 (95% uncertainty intervals - 95%UI: 1,611-6,563) deaths, while the mandatory scenarios would result in the prevention of 9,704 (95%UI: 3,955-15,665) and 15,561 (95%UI: 6,350-25,096) deaths from cardiovascular diseases, considering the lower regional and international targets, respectively. The findings suggest that the maintenance of voluntary targets has limited impact when compared to possible and more restrictive scenarios of reducing sodium content in processed and ultra-processed foods and reinforce the need to adopt measures with greater effectiveness in the country.
Doenças crônicas não transmissíveis correspondem à principal causa de morte no mundo e têm a alimentação inadequada como um de seus principais fatores de risco modificáveis, destacando-se o consumo excessivo de sódio e sua associação com doenças cardiovasculares, mediadas pela pressão arterial. Este estudo avaliou o impacto de diferentes cenários de políticas para a redução do consumo de sódio com base em alimentos processados e ultraprocessados na prevenção de mortes por desfechos cardiovasculares na população adulta no Brasil. Foram utilizados dados secundários, de relatórios e bases públicas do Sistema Único de Saúde e de inquéritos populacionais. Foram analisados os impactos, até 2027, de três cenários: manutenção das atuais metas voluntárias, e dois cenários mandatórios, considerando as menores metas nas Américas e as menores metas mundiais. Para a análise das mortes prevenidas ou adiadas com base no consumo de sódio em tais cenários foi utilizado o Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME). Em 2027, mais de 72 mil mortes seriam atribuíveis ao excesso de sódio e as metas voluntárias resultariam na prevenção ou adiamento de até 4.001 (intervalos de 95% de incerteza - II95%: 1.611-6.563) mortes, e os cenários mandatórios resultariam na prevenção de 9.704 (II95%: 3.955-15.665) e 15.561 (II95%: 6.350-25.096) mortes por doenças cardiovasculares, considerando as menores metas regionais e internacionais, respectivamente. Os achados sugerem que a manutenção de metas voluntárias tem impacto limitado quando comparada a cenários possíveis e mais restritivos de redução do teor de sódio em alimentos processados e ultraprocessados, e reforçam a necessidade de adoção de medidas com maior efetividade no país.

abstract={Background/objective: Studies that address dietary intake theme during pregnancy are generally centered on specific nutrients or on dietary patterns. However, the maternal dietary profile according to the degree of food processing is poorly understood. The purpose of the present study was to describe the dietary profile of high-risk pregnant women according to the degree of food processing. Materials and methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Prof. Dr. Jose Aristodemo Pinotti Women’s Hospital (CAISM), University of Campinas, Brazil, with high-risk pregnant women in the third trimester of gestation. Results: Data from 125 high-risk pregnant women were collected between September 2017 and April 2019. The mean total energy intake (EI) was 1778.3 ± 495.79 kcal/day and the majority of the calories was from unprocessed foods (52.42%), followed by ultra-processed foods (25.46%). The consumption of free sugar and sodium exceeded recommendations, while the consumption of fiber, calcium, folate and iron was below recommendations. The ultra-processed foods intake affects dietary patterns negatively. Conclusion: More than 50% of the EI of high-risk pregnant women is from unprocessed or minimally processed foods, but it is insufficient for meeting dairy fiber, iron, folate and calcium recommendations. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Background: Higher ultra-processed food intake has been linked with several cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases. However, prospective evidence from US populations remains scarce. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that higher intake of ultra-processed foods is associated with higher risk of coronary artery disease. Methods: A total of 13,548 adults aged 45-65 y from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study were included in the analytic sample. Dietary intake data were collected through a 66-item FFQ. Ultra-processed foods were defined using the NOVA classification, and the level of intake (servings/d) was calculated for each participant and divided into quartiles. We used Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines to assess the association between quartiles of ultra-processed food intake and incident coronary artery disease. Results: There were 2006 incident coronary artery disease cases documented over a median follow-up of 27 y. Incidence rates were higher in the highest quartile of ultra-processed food intake (70.8 per 10,000 person-y; 95% CI: 65.1, 77.1) compared with the lowest quartile (59.3 per 10,000 person-y; 95% CI: 54.1, 65.0). Participants in the highest compared with lowest quartile of ultra-processed food intake had a 19% higher risk of coronary artery disease (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.35) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health behaviors. An approximately linear relation was observed between ultra-processed food intake and risk of coronary artery disease. Conclusions: Higher ultra-processed food intake was associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease among middle-aged US adults. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and to investigate the mechanisms by which ultra-processed foods may affect health. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

abstract={Background: Excessive sodium consumption is one of the leading dietary risk factors for non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), mediated by high blood pressure. Brazil has implemented voluntary sodium reduction targets with food industries since 2011. This study aimed to analyse the potential health and economic impact of these sodium reduction targets in Brazil from 2013 to 2032. Methods: We developed a microsimulation of a close-to-reality synthetic population (IMPACTNCD-BR) to evaluate the potential health benefits of setting voluntary upper limits for sodium content as part of the Brazilian government strategy. The model estimates CVD deaths and cases prevented or postponed, and disease treatment costs. Model inputs were informed by the 2013 National Health Survey, the 2008–2009 Household Budget Survey, and high-quality meta-analyses, assuming that all individuals were exposed to the policy proportionally to their sodium intake from processed food. Costs included costs of the National Health System on CVD treatment and informal care costs. The primary outcome measures of the model are cardiovascular disease cases and deaths prevented or postponed over 20 years (2013–2032), stratified by age and sex. Results: The study found that the application of the Brazilian voluntary sodium targets for packaged foods between 2013 and 2032 could prevent or postpone approximately 110,000 CVD cases (95% uncertainty intervals (UI): 28,000 to 260,000) among men and 70,000 cases among women (95% UI: 16,000 to 170,000), and also prevent or postpone approximately 2600 CVD deaths (95% UI: − 1000 to 11,000), 55% in men. The policy could also produce a net cost saving of approximately US$ 220 million (95% UI: US$ 54 to 520 million) in medical costs to the Brazilian National Health System for the treatment of CHD and stroke and save approximately US$ 71 million (95% UI: US$ 17 to170 million) in informal costs. Conclusion: Brazilian voluntary sodium targets could generate substantial health and economic impacts. The reduction in sodium intake that was likely achieved from the voluntary targets indicates that sodium reduction in Brazil must go further and faster to achieve the national and World Health Organization goals for sodium intake. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most common bacterial pathogens, and the potential association between H. pylori infection and hypertension are controversial. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clarify their association and provide a new theoretical basis for uncovering the pathogenesis of hypertension. METHODS: Case-control and cross-sectional studies on the association between H. pylori and hypertension published from 1996 to 2019 indexed in PubMed, Google Scholar, Chinese Wan Fang Data, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated. I2 was performed to evaluate the statistical heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Begg's and Egger's test. The extracted data was analyzed in Stata 12.0. Statistical significance was defined as p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies involving 6,376 cases of hypertension and 10,850 controls were enrolled. H. pylori infection rate in hypertension patients and controls were 64.9% and 56.3%, respectively. A significantly positive association was shown between H. pylori infection and hypertension with an overall OR of 2.07 (95% CI: 1.46-2.94; p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that the prevalence of H. pylori infection was associated with hypertension in the region of Asia and the case-control group, ORs (95% CI) were 2.26 (1.51-3.38) and 2.53 (1.72-3.72), respectively. After stratifying by detection methods, differences still existed in subgroups (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicated that H. pylori infection is positively associated with hypertension.
FUNDAMENTO: Estudos epidemiológicos recentes demonstraram que alterações na microbiota e seus metabólitos estão associadas à hipertensão arterial sistêmica. A Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) é um dos patógenos bacterianos mais comuns, e a possível associação entre a infecção por H. pylori e a hipertensão é controversa. OBJETIVOS: Este estudo teve o objetivo de esclarecer a associação entre eles e proporcionar uma nova base teórica para detectar a patogênese da hipertensão. MÉTODOS: Foram selecionados estudos caso-controle e transversais sobre a associação entre H. pylori e hipertensão, publicados de 1996 a 2019 indexados nos bancos de dados PubMed, Google Scholar, Chinese Wan Fang Data, e Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). As razões de chance (RC) combinadas e o intervalo de confiança (IC) 95% foram estimados. O I² foi realizado para avaliar a heterogeneidade estatística. O viés de publicação foi avaliado utilizando-se os testes de Beggs e de Egger. Os dados extraídos foram analisados no software Stata 12.0. A significância estatística foi definida com um p-valor < 0,05. RESULTADOS: Foram cadastrados 17 estudos envolvendo 6376 casos de hipertensão e 10850 controles. A taxa de infecção por H. pylori em pacientes hipertensos e em controles foi de 64,9% e 56,3%, respectivamente. Foi demonstrada uma associação significativamente positiva entre a infecção por H. pylori e a hipertensão, com uma RC global de 2,07 (IC 95%: 1,46–2,94; p < 0,05). A análise de subgrupos revelou que a prevalência de infecção por H. pylori foi associada à hipertensão na região da Ásia e no grupo de caso-controle, as RC (IC 95%) foram 2,26 (1,51-3,38) e 2,53 (1,72-3,72), respectivamente. Depois de estratificar por métodos de detecção, ainda existiam diferenças entre os subgrupos (todos p < 0,05). CONCLUSÃO: Esta metanálise indicou que a infecção por H. pylori está associada positivamente à hipertensão.},

Time required was the only identified significant (P <.001) deterrent from enrolling in study. These HEPs had characteristics common to most HEPs: encouraging whole foods, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans other legumes, and limiting added salt, saturated fatty acids, added sugars, red meat, processed meats, and other processed foods. Further research on initiatives to ease the time burden, and increase implementation of established healthy eating principles is needed. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on glycaemic control and consumption of processed (PF) and ultraprocessed (UPF) foods in pregnant women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM). This is a randomised, controlled, single-blind clinical trial with forty-nine adult women with PGDM, followed at a public maternity hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The control group (CG) received a standard diet consisting of 45-55 % of the total energy intake of carbohydrates, 15-20 % of proteins and 25-30 % of lipids. The DASH group (DG) received an adapted DASH diet, which did not differ from the standard diet in the percentage of macronutrients, but had higher contents of fibre, unsaturated fats and minerals such as Ca, Mg and K; and lower contents of Na and saturated fats than the standard diet. In the analysis by protocol, the DG presented a higher incidence of glycaemic control after 12 weeks of intervention (57·1 v. 8·3 %, P = 0·01, moderate effect size) and a lower mean consumption of UPF (-9·9 %, P = 0·01) compared with the CG. There was no statistically significant difference in fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations, or in the consumption of PF between the groups (P > 0·05). The DASH diet may be a strategy for glycaemic control in pregnant women with PGDM, favouring the adoption of a nutritionally adequate diet with lower consumption of UPF. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of the DASH diet on glycaemic profile, and maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with PGDM. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

abstract={The modern diet is closely linked to the consumption of processed foods, causing an increase in the intake of salt, simple sugars, phosphorus and added potassium. This excess intake is associated with an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD, which according to data from the ENRICA study affects 15% of the population, magnifies its impact due to the higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension and due to limitations in the management of sodium and phosphorus. The intake of these products far exceeds the established recommendations, assuming 72% of total sodium, 25%–35% of phosphorus, 12%–18% of potassium and exceeding 10% of the caloric intake in simple sugars. Measures are necessary to reduce their contribution through nutritional advice, labeling review, education campaigns on healthy habits, fees and institutional actions that involve food safety agencies, industry, distribution and scientific societies. © 2021},

abstract={South Africa implemented legislation in June 2016 mandating maximum sodium (Na) levels in processed foods. A pre-post impact evaluation assessed whether the interim legislative approach reduced salt intake and blood pressure. Baseline Na intake was assessed in a nested cohort of the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (WHO-SAGE) Wave 2 (Aug-Dec 2015). 24-hour urine samples were collected in a random subsample (n = 1,299; of which n = 750 were considered valid (volume ≥ 300 mL and creatinine ≥ 4 mmol/day (women) or ≥ 6 mmol/day (men))). Follow-up urine samples were collected in Wave 3 (Jun 2018-Jun 2019), with replacements included for those lost to follow-up (n = 1,189; n = 548 valid). In those aged 18 − 49y, median salt intake was 7.8 (4.7, 12.0) g/day in W2 (n = 274), remaining similar in the W3 sample (7.7 (4.9, 11.3) g salt/day (n = 92); P = 0.569). In older adults (50 + y), median salt intake was 5.8 (4.0, 8.5) g/day (n = 467) in W2, and 6.0 (4.0, 8.6) g/day (n = 455) in W3 (P = 0.721). Controlling for differences in background characteristics, overall salt intake dropped by 1.15 g/day (P = 0.028). 24hr urinary Na concentrations from a countrywide South African sample suggest that salt intakes have dropped during the interim phase of mandatory sodium legislation. Further measurement of population level salt intake following stricter Na targets, enforced from June 2019, is necessary. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Introduction Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Reducing dietary salt consumption is a potentially cost-effective way to reduce blood pressure and the burden of CVD. To date, economic evidence has focused on sodium reduction in food industry or processed food with blood pressure as the primary outcome. This study protocol describes the planned within-trial economic evaluation of a low-sodium salt substitute intervention designed to reduce the risk of stroke in China. Methods and analyses The economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study: a 5-year large scale, cluster randomised controlled trial. The outcomes of interest are quality of life measured using the EuroQol-5-Dimensions and major adverse cardiovascular events. Costs will be estimated from a healthcare system perspective and will be sought from the routinely collected data available within the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted, resulting in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per cardiovascular event averted and cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, respectively. Ethics and dissemination The trial received ethics approval from the University of Sydney Ethics Committee (2013/888) and Peking University Institutional Review Board (IRB00001052-13069). Informed consent was obtained from each study participant. Findings of the economic evaluation will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences.

abstract={Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent to date the leading cause of mortality in both genders in the developed countries. In this context, a strong need for CVD prevention is emerging through lifestyle modification and nutrition. In fact, several studies linked CVD with unhealthy nutrition, alcohol consumption, stress, and smoking, together with a low level of physical activity. Thus, the primary aim is to prevent and reduce CVD risk factors, such as impaired lipid and glycemic profiles, high blood pressure and obesity. Different types of diet have been, therefore, established to optimize the approach regarding this issue such as the Mediterranean diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH), vegetarian diet, ketogenic diet, and Japanese diet. Depending on the diet type, recommendations generally emphasize subjects to increase vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and pulses consumption, but discourage or recommend eliminating red meat, sweets, and sugar-sweetened beverages, along with processed foods that are high in sugar, salt, fat, or low in dietary fiber. In particular, we evaluated and compared the peculiar aspects of these well-known dietary patterns and, thus, this review evaluates the critical factors that increase CVD risk and the potential application and benefits of nutritional protocols to ameliorate dietary and lifestyle patterns for CVD prevention. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2020.},

abstract={Background and aims: How Mediterranean-style diets impact cardiovascular and health outcomes in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not well known. Our aim was to investigate the association between diet quality, using Mediterranean Diet Scores (MDS) and health outcomes. Methods and results: This is a post-hoc analysis of an RCT and longitudinal study investigating patients with diabetes and CKD. MDS was calculated annually. Scores were analyzed for correlation with lipids, HbA1c, serum potassium, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and depression. 178 diet records from 50 patients who attended two or more visits were included. Mean MDS was moderate (4.1 ± 1.6) and stable over time. Stage 1–2 vs 3–5 CKD had lower raw MDS (3.8 ± 1.5 vs 4.6 ± 1.5, p &lt; 0.001). Having hyperkalemia was associated with a lower raw MDS scores (3.6 ± 1.6 vs 4.2 ± 1.5, p = 0.03) but not energy adjusted MDS. MDS was not associated with HbA1c or lipids. High vs low MDS was associated with improved HRQOL (mental health 84.4 ± 14.3 vs 80.3 ± 17.1, p &lt; 0.05; general health 62.6 ± 21.0 vs 56.3 ± 19.8, p &lt; 0.001) and fewer depressive symptoms (9.1 ± 7.4 vs 11.7 ± 10.6, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Low MDS was associated with reduced kidney function and health related quality of life, but not other markers of cardiovascular risk. Further studies are needed to understand the nature and direction of the association between diet quality and disease outcomes in this population. © 2021 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University},

abstract={Since the 1980s, there has been a dramatic rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in pediatric populations, in large part driven by sedentary lifestyles and changing dietary patterns with more processed foods. In parallel with the rise in pediatric obesity in the general population, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Adiposity has been implicated in a variety of mechanisms both potentiating the risk for type 1 diabetes as well as exacerbating long-term complications, particularly cardiovascular disease. Treatment options targeting the unique needs of obese pediatric patients, both before and after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, are limited. In this review, we discuss the history of the epidemiology of the obesity epidemic in the context of pediatric type 1 diabetes, highlight the possible role of obesity in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis and review the concept of “double diabetes”. The impact of obesity at and after diagnosis will be discussed, including noted differences in clinical and biochemical markers, lipid abnormalities, and long-term cardiovascular complications. Finally, we will review the existing literature on pharmacologic and nutritional interventions as potential treatment strategies for youth with coexisting type 1 diabetes and obesity. © Copyright © 2021 March, Becker and Libman.},

abstract={Excessive sodium intake is a risk factor for developing systemic arterial hypertension. Increased blood pressure during childhood increases the risk of hypertension in adulthood. Assessing sodium intake across different eating places is important, as the meals offered in different places can influence dietary quality. This study aimed to assess the contribution of different food groups to the mean of sodium intake of school-attending adolescents in the city of Niterói, a metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A total of 347 public school students aged between 10 and 18 years participated in the study. Food consumption was based on two 24-h dietary recalls. The reported items were grouped into 31 food groups and the percentage of contribution of each food group to total mean sodium intake was estimated. Sodium intake according to eating place was also estimated. The food groups mostly contributing to total sodium intake were rice, beans, savory biscuits, breads, beef, poultry, processed meat, filled cookies, pasta and potatoes. The highest sodium intake within the food groups occurred at home, except for savory biscuits and pizza, which showed a higher sodium intake percentage at school. Savory biscuits were the third-most consumed item contributing to the total sodium intake and were the main source of sodium when consumed at school (48.9%). Most sodium intake stemmed from ultra-processed food consumed at school. Therefore, actions to promote healthy eating habits within the school environment are necessary. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Magnesium (Mg) is one of the most important cations in the human organism playing an important role in many vital processes, including neuromuscular, enzymatic reactions, neurotransmitter release, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) mineral and bone disease metabolism. Moreover, higher levels of magnesium in the body are positively correlated with improved survival, while hypomagnesemia is significantly associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although serum Mg may increase in the setting of advance CKD due to the insufficient compensatory mechanism, epidemiological studies show that in real life both CKD and ESRD patients have normal and sometimes even low-serum Mg concentration. This is due to the intake of Mg coupled with other dietary intake which might interfere with intestinal absorption and dialysate Mg concentration or some drugs such as loop and thiazide diuretics, proton-pump inhibitors, chemotherapy, antimicrobials, or calcineurin inhibitors. Diet also plays a crucial role in maintaining a normal Mg balance. Magnesium is widely found in green vegetables, beans, legume, and nuts, while processed foods are poor in this cation. A plant-based diet is often discouraged in advanced CKD in an attempt to limit the potassium intake. This approach could lead to a low-Mg intake; therefore these patients should be encouraged to consume more plant-based proteins since it is well known that meat-based diets are typically much more acidic than plant-based diets, and there are health benefits associated with changing the acid–base balance in the diet. Growing evidence supports the health benefits of plant-based diets that are high in Mg and fiber and low in saturated fat and have low levels of sodium for preventing heart disease, hypertension and could even slow the progression of CKD. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The scope of this study was to examine the risk factors for the development of obesity in adolescence. The objective was to identify risk factors for adolescent obesity by means of an Integrative Review of the Literature. The PICO strategy was used to formulate the following central line of inquiry: What are the risk factors for the development of obesity during adolescence? The VHL and EBSCOhost research databases were consulted, resulting in a selection of 25 articles for in-depth study. The phenomenon of obesity was understood as the result of biological, social, psychological, and nutritional factors. The research revealed a lack of consensus on the risks and benefits, which makes evidence-based recommendations difficult. The study identified proposals that can be imple-mented, such as a change in eating habits, weight control and the practice of physical exercise. Such behavioral changes can be recommended within the context of the family, schools, and health ser-vices. The review recommends prevention strat-egies and the recognition of school as the ideal medium for health promotion through education. From a political and social standpoint, it is neces-sary to challenge the prevalence of publicity of the food industry that entices adolescents to consume processed foods with high fat and sugar content. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

abstract={Background/aim: Iodine is the basic substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis and is vital for the general population and especially pregnant women. Iodine deficiency may cause severe health problems for a foetus. This study aimed to determine the relationship, if any, between iodine level and thyroid function tests, and to determine the relationship between consumption of salt types and its effects on thyroid function tests in the first trimester of pregnancy. Materials and methods: Three hundred and six pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy, who had known no thyroid disease history and had not received iodine supportive therapy, were included in the study. All patients were questioned for their preferred table salt or rock salt in daily use and urine iodine concentrations (UICs) were analysed in spot urine. The results were evaluated statistically according to salt usage preferences. Results: The median age of patients in the study was 27.8 (± 5.4). In terms of salt consumption habits, 235 (76.8%) of patients reported using table salt, and 71 (23.2%) reported using rock salt. Iodine deficiency was found in 75.81% (n = 232) of all cases according to urinalysis. Median UICs of table salt group were significantly higher than rock salt group (123.7 µg/L and 70.9 µg/L respectively, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Although large-scale salt iodination began long time ago, iodine deficiency is still a serious health problem among pregnant women. According to this study, use of rock salt is associated with low urinary iodine concentration in pregnant women and TSH values within the reference limits are not a good indicator for determining the iodine level. © TÜBİTAK.},

abstract={Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are one of the greatest threats to public health, and have been related to poor quality dietary patterns. This study was conducted to determine the distribution of dietary risk factors in Iran. Methods: Cross-sectional data was gathered between April and November 2016 from 30,541 eligible adults (out of 31 050 individuals who were selected through systematic proportional to size cluster random sampling) living in urban and rural areas, using the WHO-based STEPs risk factor questionnaire. Low intakes of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and fish, and high intakes of salty processed food (SPF), as well as daily intake of hydrogenated fat (HF) were considered as nutritional risk factors. Results: At the national level, 82.8% (95% CI: 82.4-83.2), 57.8% (95% CI: 57.2-58.4), 80.6% (95% CI: 80.1-81) and 90.3% (95% CI: 90-90.6) of participants of all age groups had sub-optimal intakes of fruits, vegetables, dairy products and fish, respectively. Furthermore, 12.8% (95% CI: 12.4-13.1), and 29.4% (95% CI: 28.9-29.9) of respondents had high SPF intakes and HF use, respectively. At the sub-national level, the highest distribution of suboptimal intake of fruits (97.2%; 95% CI:96-98.3), vegetables (79.2%; 95% CI: 76.3-82.1) and dairy products (92.9%; 95% CI: 91-94.7) was observed in Sistan and Baluchistan. Except for Boushehr and Hormozgan, the majority of the population of other provinces consumed fish less than twice a week. Similarly, the high intake of SPF was found mostly in the population of Yazd (23.7; 95% CI: 20.2-27.2). HF consumption was the highest in North Khorasan (64.2%; 95% CI: 60.3-68.1). Conclusion: These findings highlight the widespread distribution of dietary risk factors in Iran, which should be a priority for the people and the politicians in order to prevent NCDs. © 2021 The Author(s).},

abstract={Introduction: Increased dietary salt intake can cause retention of fluid and subsequently an increase in blood pressure. Excessive salt consumption is one of the main causes of hypertension. This study aims to determine efforts done by medical students to reduce dietary salt intake and its associated factors in Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire looking into efforts to reduce dietary salt intake adapted from the WHO STEPS questionnaire was used. There were six efforts altogether which were; limiting consumption of processed food; looking into sodium contents on food labels; purchasing low salt or sodium alternatives; avoid eating out; using spices when cooking; and doing things specifically to control salt consumption. Other factors in this questionnaire are on socio-demographic, practice of salt consumption, awareness, perception, attitude of dietary salt intake. Results: A total of 362 respondents participated. The majority had good awareness on salt intake (98.1%). A larger proportion of females significantly made the effort to buy low salt alternatives (p=0.003) and avoided eating out (p=0.048). On salt consumption practice, there were a bigger proportion of those that rarely ate processed food, that avoided eating out (p=0.08), bought low salt/sodium alternatives (p<0.001), looked at the sodium contents on labels (p=0.027) and limited the consumption of processed food (p<0.001). Conclusion: There are significant associations between the female gender and practice of eating processed food with efforts to decrease salt intake. More studies are recommended to look into assisting efforts to reduce salt consumption. © 2021 UPM Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Aims: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a strong predictor of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Studies in urban India have found about one-third of Indians suffer from MetS. Less is known about the prevalence of MetS in rural areas, where 70% of the population reside. This study examined the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in a population of rural women in India. Methods: Data were gathered in a community-based study of 500 rural and tribal women residing in the Mysore district, between the age of 30–59 years. The study used the WHO STEPS approach, in which information on demographics and behavioral risk factors were collected. Along with anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, blood glucose, lipids were measured. A harmonized definition of MetS recommended by International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention was used in this study. Results: Three out of five study participants were found to have MetS (47.1%, n = 223). Of those, 56.5% met 3 of the 5 criteria, 32.2% met 4 criteria, and 11.2% met all 5 criteria. Among the entire sample, low HDL was the most prevalent criterion (88.4%), followed by elevated glucose (57.9%), elevated triglycerides (49.3%), elevated BP (41.5%), and increased waist circumference (15.3%). In this sample, women with METS were generally older (p < 0.001), housewives (p = 0.001), that consumed salty highly processed foods (p = 0.020) and had low physical activity (p = 0.015). Conclusions: This study showed a high prevalence of MetS in rural women. There is a compelling need for interventions aimed at reducing CHD risk factors in this population. © 2020 Cardiological Society of India},

abstract={Background: Portugal was not exception to the European panorama of high salt consumption, registering high prevalence of hypertension and being cardiovascular diseases the leading cause of death in the last decade. In 2012, Portugal compromised to target the reduction of salt intake in the population by 30% until 2025 with a target of 5 g per day. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present an overview of the last decade (2009-2019) of salt reduction policies implemented in Portugal with the objective of reducing the dietary salt intake of the population, through one narrative review. Methods: A documentary and bibliographical review of scientific articles and governmental documents published between January 2009 and December 2019 was carried out. Results: Was identified fourteen initiatives implemented using different policy tools (voluntary agreements with industry, mandatory legislation, etc.), and trying comprehensive food system interventions to promote the production, distribution and consumption of less salt.. Conclusions: To achieve the 2025 goals, the challenge is the implementation of effective action strategies (including innovative approaches) and the monitoring of consumption trends. © 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Nutricion Comunitaria.

abstract={Objective: The aims of this investigation were to determine whether the daily dietary intake of nutrients by patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication (IC) met recommended levels for adults older than 50 years and to determine whether meeting recommended levels of nutrients was associated with ankle-brachial index (ABI), inflammation, and ambulation of patients with PAD and IC. Methods: A total of 48 patients were assessed on their dietary intake of 20 nutrients during a 3-day period. Patients were further characterized on demographic variables, comorbid conditions, cardiovascular risk factors, ABI, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration. Results: Few patients met the daily recommended intakes for calcium (4%), fiber (6%), vitamin E (6%), trans fatty acids (13%), vitamin A (15%), total sugars (19%), potassium (23%), sodium (29%), saturated fat (29%), and vitamin C (31%), and none of the patients met the daily recommended intake of vitamin D (0%). Overall, patients met few of the 20 dietary recommendations as the median score was seven recommendations. Only 17 of 48 patients met more than seven of the recommendations. For the ABI regression model adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, body mass index, and percentage body fat, the only significant predictor was total sugars (P < .001); patients who did not meet the recommendation had lower ABI values. For the hsCRP-adjusted regression model, the strongest significant predictor was omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (P = .001), indicating that those who did not meet the recommendation had higher hsCRP values. Finally, for the 6MWD-adjusted regression model, folate (P = .011) and dietary score index (P = .014) were significant predictors; those who did not meet the recommendation for folate and those who met 5 or fewer of the 20 recommendations had shorter 6MWD. Conclusions: Patients with PAD and IC consume a low-nutrient-dense diet that is deficient in many vitamins, calcium, fruits, and vegetables and contains too much added sugar, saturated and trans fats, and processed foods. In addition, more severe PAD, greater inflammation, and ambulatory dysfunction are independently associated with aspects of a low-nutrient-dense diet, such as too much intake of added sugars, low intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and folate, and meeting the recommended intakes of only five or fewer nutrients. © 2020 Society for Vascular Surgery},

abstract={Background: The temporality between the mandated reduction of salt in processed food and the decrease of death from stroke and ischemic heart disease, the association of hypertension, and cardiovascular disease led many public health organizations to recommend reducing dietary sodium to a maximum of 2300 mg per day. It turns out that some nuances can be brought about to this universally shared belief. Methods & Results: Indeed, consideration of health outcomes instead of only blood pressure as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease and prognosis gave contradictory results whereas low sodium intake is associated to an excess of death and cardiovascular events. Conclusions: Accordingly, sodium intake should be adapted to individual risk factors, and evidence is still clearly lacking to support indiscriminate recommendations in healthy people. By contrast, a restricted sodium diet is certainly useful in patients with chronic kidney disease exposed to salt retention, and by reciprocity, low sodium diet must be absolutely avoided in all patients presenting renal or extra renal sodium wasting where sodium depletion is a life-threatening condition. © 2019, IPNA.},

abstract={Background and objectives: Cured ham is one of the most characteristic foods in the Spanish diet. Because it is a red processed meat and due to its nutritional composition, including high sodium content, a potential association between cured ham consumption and a higher risk of hypertension could be expected. However, epidemiological studies evaluating this association are scarce. We prospectively assessed the association between cured ham consumption and the incidence of hypertension. Methods: The “Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra” (SUN) study is a cohort of Spanish middle-aged adult university graduates (average age: 38 (SD: 12) years, 60% women). We included 13,900 participants of the SUN cohort free of hypertension at baseline. One serving of cured ham is 50 g. They were classified into 4 categories of cured ham consumption: <1; 1; 2–4 and ≥5 servs/week. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were fitted to assess the association between cured ham consumption and subsequent hypertension risk using the category of lowest consumption as the reference. Results: After a median follow-up of 10.9 years, 1465 incident self-reported cases of hypertension were identified. After adjusting for potential confounders, including dietary confounders, a high consumption of cured ham (≥5 servs/week vs. <1 serv/week) was not significantly associated with hypertension risk in this prospective cohort (HR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.70–1.10, p linear trend = 0.40). Conclusions: Our results showed that cured ham consumption was not associated with a significantly higher or lower risk of hypertension in a prospective cohort of Spanish middle-aged adult university graduates. Further longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to disentangle the association between cured ham consumption and the risk of hypertension. © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.},

abstract={Background: The Food Guide for the Brazilian Population relies on natural or minimally processed foods mainly of plant origin such as beans and rice with low oil, salt, and sugar content and limited consumption of ultraprocessed foods. Reduction of ultraprocessed foods improves diet quality and energy consumption. Objective: The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention for the treatment of obesity in children, with counseling based on the Brazilian Food Guide plus control of total energy intake. Methods: A parallel, randomized clinical trial will include children aged 7 to 12 years. Randomization will be performed in blocks of 10 individuals using computer-generated random sequence numbers. Both the control and intervention groups will participate in 6 standardized educational activities based on the 10 steps of the Brazilian Food Guide. These activities will be conducted at the University Hospital Toy Library, located in the pediatric outpatient clinic. For the intervention group, in addition to the educational activities, an individualized food plan based on the nutritional recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics will be prescribed and discussed with the mothers and fathers. The primary outcome of the study will be variations in body mass index, and secondary outcomes will include analysis of insulin resistance, blood pressure, body fat percentage, and waist and neck circumference. Results: This project was funded by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development in December 2017 (grant no 408333/2017-0). Recruitment began in August 2018 and by September 2019, we had enrolled the 101 participants. In addition to the patients referred by the national system of regulation, recruitment was made by medical outpatient referral and external indication. This is an ongoing study. We expect the results to be published in November 2020. Conclusions: At the end of the project, in case of a positive result, a protocol for the treatment of obesity based on the Brazilian Food Guide will be proposed to the Unified Health System. A successful method to reduce childhood obesity is expected. © 2019 Croatian Conservation Institute. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Introduction High dietary sodium is a leading contributor to hypertension, and hypertension is the leading underlying cause of death globally. There is a robust body of evidence supporting the health benefits of sodium reduction. Sodium intake in South Korea is high, with about half the population consuming >4000 mg/day, twice the recommended upper limit. Methods In 2012, South Korea implemented its National Plan to Reduce Sodium Intake, with a goal of reducing population sodium consumption by 20%, to 3900 mg/day, by 2020. The plan included five key components: (1) a consumer awareness campaign designed to change food consumption behaviours; (2) increased availability of low-sodium foods at schools and worksites; (3) increased availability of low-sodium meals in restaurants; (4) voluntary reformulation of processed foods to lower sodium content; and (5) development of low-sodium recipes for food prepared at home. Monitoring and evaluation included tracking sodium intake and sources of dietary sodium using the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Results By 2014, South Korea had reduced dietary sodium consumption among adults by 23.7% compared to a survey conducted in 2010 prior to implementation of a nationwide salt reduction campaign that used this comprehensive, multipronged approach. The reductions in sodium intake were accompanied by reductions in population blood pressure and hypertension prevalence. Although causal associations between the sodium reduction programme and reduced sodium intake cannot be made, the declines occurred with the introduction of the programme. Conclusion Multicomponent interventions have great potential to reduce population sodium intake. Lessons learnt from South Korea could be applied to other countries and are likely very relevant to other Asian countries with similar food sources and consumption profiles. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

abstract={Background: Findings from previous studies on associations between prepregnancy dietary patterns and preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW) are limited and inconsistent. Objectives: To examine the association between prepregnancy dietary patterns and the risk of preterm birth and LBW. Methods: This study included 3422 and 3508 singleton live births from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) for the analyses of preterm birth and LBW, respectively. We included women who were nulliparous and nonpregnant at baseline surveys. We used factor analyses and the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) score to derive maternal dietary patterns. Four dietary patterns were identified with factor analyses: meats and high-fats; prudent diets; sugar, refined grains, and processed foods; and traditional vegetables. Preterm birth and LBW were assessed using maternal reports from ALSWH data between 2003 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used. Results: Greater adherence to the traditional vegetables pattern before pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of preterm birth and spontaneous preterm birth after adjustments for lifestyle factors and pregnancy complications, highest compared with lowest tertile (adjusted OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.99) and (RR ratio = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.00), respectively. However, these associations were attenuated by the prepregnancy BMI. No significant associations were observed between prepregnancy dietary patterns and LBW. Conclusion: This study suggests that better adherence to the traditional vegetables pattern before pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of preterm birth, particularly spontaneous preterm birth among nulliparous women. This finding warrants further examination. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Background: Intervention strategies to reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake may decrease blood pressure; however, most are focused on reducing sodium in processed food globally. Objectives: We attempt to fill important gaps in understanding the dynamics of these dietary determinants of hypertension in China. Methods: We used data on 29,926 adults aged ≥20 y between 1991 and 2015 from an ongoing cohort, the China Health and Nutrition Survey. We collected detailed diet data with use of weighing methods with 3 consecutive 24-h recalls. With panel data random-effects models, we analyzed factors associated with sodium and potassium intakes and sodium to potassium (Na/K) ratios. Results: Sodium intake decreased from 6.3 g/d in 1991 to 4.1 g/d in 2015, still twice the tolerable upper intake recommended by the WHO. Potassium intake was 1.7 g/d in 1991 and 1.5 g/d in 2015, below half that recommended by the WHO. The Na/K ratio decreased from 4.1 (ratios in g) in 1991 to 3.1 in 2015, 5 times the recommendation of the WHO. More than two-thirds (67%) of sodium intake was from salt added during food preparation, with 8.8% from processed foods in 2015, up from 5.0% in 1991. The most at-risk populations lived in China’s central region and rural areas, were middle aged, had lower educations, or were farmers. Conclusions: Sodium intake is very high across all regions in China. As part of sodium reduction efforts, China should target people living in the central region and adults aged above 60 whose sodium intakes are much higher. Strategies to decrease sodium intake and increase potassium intake should be different from those applied in the Western world where the major source is processed food. Reduced sodium higher potassium salts should become a major policy initiative in China. J Nutr 2020;150:1230–1239. Copyright ©C The Author(s) on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2020.},

abstract={Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and if untreated can lead to renal failure. The cause of hypertension (raised blood pressure [BP]) is uncertain but is determined by diet and lifestyle and may have its origins in early development. Improvements in maternal pregnancy outcomes and improved infant nutrition may partially explain the secular decline in BP seen in many affluent communities. This chapter reviews the evidence for the relationship between specific dietary factors and hypertension. Decreasing the intake of salt, restricting alcohol intake to fewer units per day, losing excess weight, and increasing the intake of fruit, and vegetables in a combination diet can lower systolic/diastolic BP by up to 8/4mmHg in those with hypertension and but about half as much in those with normal/high normal BP. However, it is difficult to restrict salt intake without the cooperation of the food industry. The strategy of encouraging the food industry to decrease the addition of salt to food and the use salt substitutes such as potassium chloride in processed food can make an important contribution to reducing salt intakes and lowering population BP. Even small changes in population BP are likely to substantially reduce the burden of CVD in the population. © 2020 International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).},

She was treated for a presumed diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis with corticosteroids and subsequently developed an intense retro-orbital pain in the right eye. Fundus examination revealed a white, vascularized chorioretinal mass at the equator of the eye in the inferotemporal quadrant. Antibiotics were given and a vitrectomy was performed. The culture of the vitreous showed Nocardia nova and a diagnosis of disseminated Nocardiosis was made. Conclusion and Significance: Although uncommon, it is important that ophthalmologists are aware of Nocardial infections as a differential diagnosis of retinal mass, particularly in immunocompromised patients. © 2020 Gagnon and Saab.},

abstract={In Brazil, the promotion, protection, and recovery of health are among the initiatives provided by the public and universal Unified Health System (SUS). The primary healthcare level (PHC), the preferred point of access to the system, plays the role of coordinating and ordinating health care services and actions in the network. In the context of PHC, feeding and nutrition efforts must be aligned with National Feeding and Nutrition Policy (PNAN) guidelines and may be supported by feeding and nutritional surveillance actions. Data from PHC information systems and population surveys show that excess weight affects more than half the adult population of Brazil, and that consumption of ultra-processed foods is on the rise. This scenario requires that health care teams be prepared to prioritize initiatives for users with chronic diseases, using risk stratification, stabilization of the disease, and enhancement of supported self-care with a focus on diet and physical activity. At the same time, considering the country’s epidemiological profile, teams must carry out initiatives to fight undernutrition and prevent anemia and hypovitaminosis A to address the multiple burden of malnutrition. The present article describes the current scenario of feeding and nutrition initiatives implemented at the PHC level in Brazil via the SUS. © 2020 Pan American Health Organization.

abstract={Background. Hypertension and its complications are among the major health problems all over the world, particularly in developing countries. The aims of this study were to show that, weather the hypertensive patients follow the expertise recommendations and differences between men and women in their levels of knowledge and behavior in salt taking. Methods. The present cross-sectional study was conducted among all hypertensive patients in rural health centers of Tabriz, Iran, in Feb-May; 2016. Data were collected by an interviewer-administrated questionnaire, along with anthropometric, blood pressure, and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion measurements. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to compute adjusted odds ratio (OR). Results. In all 205 patients, 62.9% female, 40.5% aged over 60 years, and 53.7% with low or moderate socioeconomic status, 49.3% body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2 and above, 10.2% of the patients had systolic/diastolic equal and above (≥) 40/90 mmHg, participated in the study. In total, 16.6% were aware of the daily salt allowance for healthy people with sex difference (P&lt;0.001). Significant predictors of adding salt beyond the dietary recommendations in food preparation were occupation (unemployed) (OR = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.041-15.78, (P=0.044)) and blood pressure level (systolic/diastolic ≥140/90) (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.28-5.96 (P=0.010)), while adding salt at the table correlated with sex (men) (OR = 4.47, 95% CI = 1.21-16.57 (P=0.025)), age (54-59) (OR = 0.05 95% CI = 0.01-0.39, (P=0.005)), and knowledge (general) (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.99-1.13 (P=0.05)). Conclusion. The different pattern of salt intake was observed between men and women. In general, the amount of salt taken by hypertensive patients is higher than recommended allowances. Both men and women add extra amount of salt to food, women when preparing food and men at the table. Salt intake level both during preparing and eating food may be associated with occupation (unemployed), blood pressure level (systolic/diastolic ≥140/90), sex (men), age (54-59), and also patient knowledge (general). © 2020 Parvin Reyhani et al.},

abstract={Background. Rising levels of hypertension and the associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are of global public health concern. Evidence is emerging regarding the crucial role of sodium in regulating blood pressure in children. Processed foods high in fat, sugar or sodium have been identified as a key contributing factor to childhood obesity and diet-related NCDs. Objectives. To determine the true sodium content of processed foods frequently consumed by children aged 2-5 years in Tlokwe Municipality in North-West Province, South Africa, and to determine whether the current sodium regulation (R214) includes high-sodium foods frequently consumed by young children. Methods. Frequently counsumed processed foods were identified using an unquantified food frequency questionnaire. Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine the true sodium content of identified foods following microwave digestion. Results. True sodium content was identified in 45 food products from 15 food categories. The majority of the products (86.7%) were included in R214. The measured sodium content of products differed from what was reported on the nutrition information labels, with differences ranging from 4.1% to 40.7%. Conclusion. The majority of the food products consumed by children in this study are included in R214. These findings provide valuable information to support future studies on a larger set of processed foods frequently consumed by young children. © 2020, Health and Medical Publishing Group.

abstract={The provision of healthy and safe food is vital for human health, and the addition of unnecessary sugars in foodstuffs is an important global issue, leading to multiple long-and short-term health issues and spiraling costs for individuals and governments alike. The negative effect of excess sugar consumption contributes to adverse health conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and poor oral health in both high and low resource settings. A key plank of governmental and health promotion bodies’ nutritional guidance is to raise public awareness of “hidden” sugars, salt, and fats, such as found in processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and guide individuals to reduce their consumption. This rapid narrative review brings together some of the key issues identified in the literature around the consumption of SSBs, including patterns of consumption, the general impact on human health and nutrition, specific effects on oral health and the oral microbiome, and strategies to address over-con-sumption. The range of long-term adverse effects on health is often misunderstood or unknown by the public. However, some strategies have succeeded in reducing the consumption of SSBs, including public health strategies and interventions and the imposition of taxes or levies, and this article makes recommendations for action. © 2020, Codon Publications.

In the general healthy population several studies have demonstrated a deleterious effect of too low salt intake. In a cohort of 322,624 healthy subjects followed for seven years, Welsh et al. confirmed the linear relationship between the 24-hour sodium excretion levels and the mean arterial pressure. However, they did not found any relationship between sodium excretion and cardiovascular risk, fatal or not, or between sodium excretion and the risk of all causes death in these healthy subjects with low cardiovascular risk at baseline. In the current state of knowledge, it seems reasonable to continue to disseminate and respect the recommendations of limitation of sodium intake in the diet of the general population.

abstract={Justification: In view of easy availability and increasing trend of consumption of fast foods and sugar sweetened beverages (fruit juices and drinks, carbonated drinks, energy drinks) in Indian children, and their association with increasing obesity and related non-communicable diseases, there is a need to develop guidelines related to consumption of foods and drinks that have the potential to increase this problem in children and adolescents. Objectives: To review the evidence and formulate consensus statements related to terminology, magnitude of problem and possible ill effects of junk foods, fast foods, sugar-sweetened beverages and carbonated drinks; and to formulate recommendations for limiting consumption of these foods and beverages in Indian children and adolescents. Process: A National Consultative group constituted by the Nutrition Chapter of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP), consisting of various stakeholders in private and public sector, reviewed the literature and existing guidelines and policy regulations. Detailed review of literature was circulated to the members, and the Group met on 11th March 2019 at New Delhi for a day-long deliberation on framing the guidelines. The consensus statements and recommendations formulated by the Group were circulated to the participants and a consensus document was finalized. Conclusions: The Group suggests a new acronym ‘JUNCS’ foods, to cover a wide variety of concepts related to unhealthy foods (Junk foods, Ultra-processed foods, Nutritionally inappropriate foods, Caffeinated/colored/carbonated foods/beverages, and Sugar-sweetened beverages). The Group concludes that consumption of these foods and beverages is associated with higher free sugar and energy intake; and is associated with higher body mass index (and possibly with adverse cardiometabolic consequences) in children and adolescents. Intake of caffeinated drinks may be associated with cardiac and sleep disturbances. The Group recommends avoiding consumption of the JUNCS by all children and adolescents as far as possible and limit their consumption to not more than one serving per week. The Group recommends intake of regional and seasonal whole fruits over fruit juices in children and adolescents, and advises no fruit juices/drinks to infants and young children (age <2 y), whereas for children aged 2–5 y and >5–18 y, their intake should be limited to 125 mL/day and 250 mL/day, respectively. The Group recommends that caffeinated energy drinks should not be consumed by children and adolescents. The Group supports recommendations of ban on sale of JUNCS foods in school canteens and in near vicinity, and suggests efforts to ensure availability and affordability of healthy snacks and foods. The Group supports traffic light coding of food available in school canteens and recommends legal ban of screen/print/digital advertisements of all the JUNCS foods for channels/magazines/websites/social media catering to children and adolescents. The Group further suggests communication, marketing and policy/taxation strategies to promote consumption of healthy foods, and limit availability and consumption of the JUNCS foods. © 2019, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.},

abstract={Epidemiological evidence has shown that lower salt intake reduces hypertension-related disease mortality. Japan has experienced a drastic decrease in cardiovascular mortality, although this varies across regions. This regional variation does not necessarily match the local patterns of reported average salt intake. In this study, we examined population-level risk factors for hypertension-related disease mortality, focussing on the average household dietary consumption of salt intake sources. Methods: We prepared an ecological panel dataset, with prefecture as the unit of analysis, by referring to public statistics and market research data from 2012 to 2015. We collected prefectural averages of household dietary consumption related to salt intake and other nutrients that may affect hypertension control. We used demographic characteristics, medical care availability and local economy indices as covariates. Panel data analysis with fixed-effects modelling was performed, regressing prefectural-level mortality from ischaemic heart diseases, subarachnoid and intracerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction on dietary consumption and the selected covariates. Results: We confirmed the average household consumption of salt equivalents of discretional salt intake sources to be positively but only weakly associated with mortality from ischaemic heart diseases and cerebral infarction. Household expenditure on processed foods was positively associated with ischaemic heart disease mortality. Conclusions: These findings may suggest that the reduction of salt in processed foods, in addition to individual behavioural change, could be useful for decreasing mortality from ischaemic heart diseases in the Japanese population. Ecological factors related to decreasing cerebrovascular disease mortality in the context of the ageing Japanese population require further investigation. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

abstract={In Argentina, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and represent 1/3 of total mortality. In 2017, hypertension prevalence for inhabitants ≥18 years old was 36.3%, and its level of knowledge and control (<140/90 mm Hg) were 61% and 24%, respectively. Furthermore, 56% of people treated with antihypertensive drugs do not reach therapeutic goal. In addition to this, prevalence of other risk factors, such as sedentary lifestyle, overweight-obesity, high blood glucose/diabetes, and high cholesterol, has worsened in the last 5 years. The governmental initiative "Less Salt More Life" intends to reduce salt consumption in the entire population and promoted a National Law, which establishes the progressive salt reduction in processed foods. This initiative is probably related to the reduction of salt use after cooking or sitting at the table, observed in the Risk Factors National Survey. Furthermore, previously published studies showed, in relatively small samples from Argentina, that populational blood pressure can be decreased and hypertension control can be improved using community-based or multicomponent intervention programs. However, no specific designed national effort for hypertension control is now officially applied. In consequence, we believe that, in order to increase hypertension control, the effort should not focus on developing new strategies, but on quickly implementing and maintaining those local multicomponent interventions that have already proven to be effective. ©2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Excess sodium intake can increase blood pressure, and high blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Accurate population sodium intake estimates are essential for monitoring progress toward reduction, but data are limited on the amount of sodium consumed from discretionary salt. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare measured sodium intake from salt added at the table with that estimated according to the Healthy People 2020 (HP 2020) methodology. Methods: Data were analyzed from the 2014 Salt Sources Study, a cross-sectional convenience sample of 450 white, black, Asian, and Hispanic adults living in Alabama, Minnesota, and California. Sodium intake from foods and beverages was assessed for each participant through the use of 24-h dietary recalls. Estimated sodium intake from salt used at the table was assessed from self-reported frequency and estimated amounts from a previous study (HP 2020 methodology). Measured intake was assessed through the use of duplicate salt samples collected on recall days. Results: Among all study participants, estimated and measured mean sodium intakes from salt added at the table were similar, with a nonsignificant difference of 8.9 mg/d (95% CI:-36.6, 54.4 mg/d). Among participants who were non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic, had a bachelor's degree or higher education, lived in California or Minnesota, did not report hypertension, or had normal BMI, estimated mean sodium intake was 77-153 mg/d greater than measured intake (P < 0.05). The estimated mean sodium intake was 186-300 mg/d lower than measured intake among participants who were non-Hispanic black, had a high school degree or less, or reported hypertension (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The HP 2020 methodology for estimating sodium consumed from salt added at the table may be appropriate for the general US adult population; however, it underestimates intake in certain population subgroups, particularly non-Hispanic black, those with a high school degree or less, or those with self-reported hypertension.

abstract={Background and objective: Recent studies have related the consumption of ultra-processed foods with the development of cardiovascular diseases and have considered this relation with excessive sodium intake. While Brazilian studies have analysed that this consumption may have no direct relationship with the processing, but rather with the addition of salt. The purpose of this study is to investigate the contribution of the consumption of processed products in the daily intake of sodium ingestion by atherosclerotic disease patients. Methods: A sub study, conducted with data from 630 cardiopathic patients who take part in “Effect of Brazilian Cardioprotective Food Program study on the reduction of events and risk factors in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease part”. Food was classified as: unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods, ultra-processed food and beverages. Twenty-four-hour food recall (R24h) was collected from patients, and the estimation of total calories and sodium intake were calculated, as well as the percentage of sodium contribution according to the categories already mentioned. For the adequacy ratio analysis, the daily values of sodium intake were used to compared to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (<2000 mg / day). Results: The average sodium intake was 1970.87 mg for women and 2642.86 mg for men, being higher for males' patients aged 60–79. It was observed that 64% of the studied population demonstrated sodium intake > 2000 mg. When considered levels > 3001 mg, a higher incidence of consumption was observed in the male group. Only 21.1% were intaking sodium within the recommended amount. Industrialized foods contributed to 33% of the mineral intake. Conclusion: These findings have demonstrated that the majority of the studied patients exceeded the dietary sodium recommendation. It has also indicated that patient's male, have presented increased consumption of the mineral. Consequently, warning for the necessity of greater investments in the nutritional re-education of these patients. © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism},

abstract={Purpose of reviewThe purpose of this study is to review the current literature related to the role of inorganic phosphate in the pathogenesis of hypertension.Recent findingsAn increasing number of publications have revealed a detrimental role of inorganic phosphate, which is commonly used as a flavor enhancer or preservative in the processed food, in promoting hypertension in otherwise healthy individuals. Animal experimental data indicate that dietary phosphate excess engages multiple mechanisms that promote hypertension, including overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, increased vascular stiffness, impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, as well as increased renal sodium absorption or renal injury. These effects may be explained by direct effects of high extracellular phosphate levels or increase in phosphaturic hormones such as fibroblast growth factor 23, or downregulation of klotho, a transmembrane protein expressed in multiple organs which possess antiaging property.SummaryDietary phosphate, particularly inorganic phosphate, is an emerging risk factor for hypertension which is ubiquitous in the western diet. Large randomized clinical trials are needed to determine if lowering dietary phosphate content constitutes an effective nonpharmacologic intervention for prevention and treatment of hypertension. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

abstract={Aim: Limited information exists regarding the implementation of salt reduction strategies on collective food services, such as restaurants and food concessionaires. The present study aimed to assess the effect of a salt reduction strategy on blood pressure levels and food acceptability among customers of a food concessionaire. Methods: A quasi-experimental study with two phases was conducted. In the pre-intervention phase, the amount of salt used in food preparation was determined. In the intervention phase, a reduction of 20% in salt added to food preparations was implemented. Four hedonic tests and two blood pressure measurements were performed before and after the intervention implementation using standardised techniques. In addition, an evaluation of uneaten food was conducted daily on all customers’ plates. Mixed linear regression models were generated to assess the effect of the intervention on blood pressure and acceptability. Results: A total of 71 workers were evaluated, mean age of 37.5 years, 57.8% females, who consumed the food of the concessionaire, on average, 4.4 (SD: 0.7) days per week. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 3.1 (P < 0.001) and 2.9 (P < 0.001) mmHg at the end of the study, respectively. The results of the hedonic tests and the uneaten food before and after the intervention did not vary significantly. Conclusions: The reduction of 20% of salt added to food from a concessionaire had a positive impact on the reduction of customers’ blood pressure without reducing food acceptability. This strategy could be implemented in other contexts. © 2018 The Authors. Nutrition & Dietetics published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Dietitians Association of Australia},

abstract={The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study estimated national salt intake for 187 countries based on data available up to 2010. The purpose of this review was to identify studies that have measured salt intake in a nationally representative population using the 24-hour urine collection method since 2010, with a view to updating evidence on population salt intake globally. Studies published from January 2011 to September 2018 were searched for from MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases using relevant terms. Studies that provided nationally representative estimates of salt intake among the healthy adult population based on the 24-hour urine collection were included. Measured salt intake was extracted and compared with the GBD estimates. Of the 115 identified studies assessed for eligibility, 13 studies were included: Four studies were from Europe, and one each from the United States, Canada, Benin, India, Samoa, Fiji, Barbados, Australia, and New Zealand. Mean daily salt intake ranged from 6.75 g/d in Barbados to 10.66 g/d in Portugal. Measured mean population salt intake in Italy, England, Canada, and Barbados was lower, and in Fiji, Samoa, and Benin was higher, in recent surveys compared to the GBD 2010 estimates. Despite global targets to reduce population salt intake, only 13 countries have published nationally representative salt intake data since the GBD 2010 study. In all countries, salt intake levels remain higher than the World Health Organization's recommendation, highlighting the need for additional global efforts to lower salt intake and monitor salt reduction strategies. ©2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Objective: To assess salt intake and its dietary sources using biochemical and self-report methods and to characterize salt intake according to sociodemographic and disease-related variables in a sample of the Brazilian population. Design: Population-based cross-sectional survey. Setting: Salt intake was assessed by biochemical (24 h urinary Na excretion) and self-report methods (sodium FFQ, 24 h dietary recall, seasoned-salt questionnaire, discretionary-salt questionnaire and total reported salt intake). Participants: Adults and older people (n 517) aged 20-80 years, living in Artur Nogueira, São Paulo, Brazil. Results: Mean salt intake based on 24 h urinary Na excretion and total reported salt intake was 10.5 and 11.0 g/d, respectively; both measures were significantly correlated. Discretionary salt and seasoned salt were the most important sources of salt intake (68.2 %). Men in the study consumed more salt than women as estimated by 24 h urinary Na excretion (11.7 v. 9.6 g salt/d; P<0.0001). Participants known to be hypertensive added more salt to their meals but consumed less salty ultra-processed foods. Waist circumference in both sexes and BMI were positively correlated with salt intake estimated by 24 h urinary Na excretion. In addition, regression analysis revealed that being a young male or having a high waist circumference was a predictor of higher salt intake. Conclusions: Salt intake in this population was well above the recommended amount. The main source of salt intake came from salt added during cooking. Salt intake varied according to sex and waist circumference. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Restriction of dietary salt is widely recommended in the management of hypertension, but assessment of individual salt intake has drawn little attention. Monitoring nutritional salt intake through sodium excretion has been popular, because the main route for sodium (Na) excretion is through the urine. Nonetheless, direct measurement of dietary salt intake is time consuming and lacks accuracy. To collect a 24-h urine and measure the content is difficult method for most patients. In this review paper, we would like to explore the usefulness of measuring urinary salt excretion by using a self-monitoring device at home. Measuring daily overnight urine by the self-monitoring device at home will be useful for the management of hypertension suitable for each individual. From the recent increase of processed foods, the term "salt intake" would not accurately be equal to "sodium intake". Devices measuring urinary sodium excretion have been developed and evaluated on their accuracy and correlation with sodium intake. They must be handy, simple and capable of measuring large populations to be useful for monitoring of daily salt intake and to guide salt restriction as well as the long-term effects by dietary salt intake. © 2019 The Author(s).},

Materials and methods: About 200 respondents aged between 18 and 59 years old from Kuala Nerus, Terengganu were recruited. Their dietary intake from two days of 24-hour dietary recall underwent NOVA classification and analyzed through Nutritionist Pro. All respondents had their blood pressure and fasting blood glucose taken. Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between sodium and added sugar each of NOVA food groups and the nutritional status. Results: The total energy intake of the respondents was 1818 kcal ± 375.05 per day. The energy contribution of ultra-processed group was 24%. The sodium and added sugar contribution of ultra-processed group were 26% and 63%, respectively. The mean blood pressure and median of blood glucose were normal at 114/79 mmHg and 5.3 mmol/L, respectively. No significant correlation was found between sodium, added sugar availability of each NOVA food groups and nutritional status at p<0.05. Conclusion: Further studies involving vigorous research design need to be carried out in order to really understand the implication of ultra-processed food consumption towards the nutritional status of Malaysian population, as highlighted in the Malaysian Nutrition Research Priorities (2016-2020). © 2020 2020 © The Authors.

abstract={There are many causes for hypertension, but among the modifiable factors, inadequate lifestyle is related to the higher prevalence of the disease. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the association between macro and micronutrient intake and blood pressure levels with the degree of food processing. Sixty-four adults from the rural area of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil were evaluated. Food consumption was assessed by a dietary recall using AVANUTRI Software, and the foods consumed were classified into three groups: in natura or minimally processed, processed and ultra-processed. Blood pressure was measured using an automatic inflation monitor. The data were analyzed in the Stata Software by means of the Student's T test. Most of the sample consisted of female adults (64.1%) and the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 122.8 mmHg (±17.1) and 77.7 mmHg (±10.9), respectively. The group of in natura or minimally processed food was responsible for the largest contribution (85.2%) of the average caloric intake (1,793.1 kcal/ day), while the consumption of ultra-processed foods was only 7.7%. In addition, there was a higher intake of carbohydrate, lipid, cholesterol, polyunsaturated fat, vitamin E, potassium and sodium among individuals who consumed only in natura or minimally processed foods. Individuals who did not consume ultra-processed foods had higher intakes of vitamin E and sodium. It was concluded that there was an association between the degree of food processing and nutrient intake, however, no association was found among blood pressure levels. © 2019 Centro Universitario Sao Camilo.

abstract={This review aims to summarize and synthesize studies reporting on changes in sodium levels in packaged food products, restaurant foods, and hospital or school meals, as a result of salt reduction interventions. Studies were extracted from those published in the Science of Salt Weekly between June 2013 and February 2018. Twenty-four studies were identified: 17 assessed the changes in packaged foods, four in restaurant foods, two in hospital or school meals, and one in both packaged and restaurant foods. Three types of interventions were evaluated as part of the studies: voluntary reductions (including targets), labeling, and interventions in institutional settings. Decreases in sodium were observed in all studies (n = 8) that included the same packaged foods matched at two time points, and in the studies carried out in hospitals and schools. However, there was little to no change in mean sodium levels in restaurant foods. The pooled analysis of change in sodium levels in packaged foods showed a decrease in sodium in unmatched food products (−36 mg/100 g, 95% CI −51 to −20 mg/100 g) and in five food categories—breakfast cereals, breads, processed meats, crisps and snacks, and soups. Twenty-two of the 24 studies were from high-income countries, limiting the applicability of the findings to lower resource settings. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Introduction: one of the changes in diet is related to its content of sodium (Na) and potassium (K). Greater use of condiments and processed foods contributes to these changes and the Na/K ratio can be used as a marker of this consumption. Objective: to evaluate the association between Na/K ratio and consumption of industrialized condiments and ultra-processed foods. Methods: a sample of 150 adults underwent an anthropometric examination and answered the questionnaire on life habits, diet and health. Consumption of Na, K and salt was estimated by urinary excretion of 24 hours. Ultraprocessed consumption was estimated by 24-hour food registration. Na/K ratio divided into tertiles. Associations between ultraprocessed foods, use of industrialized condiments and Na/K ratio were tested. p < 0.05 was adopted. Results: the highest proportion was female (65%) and with a higher educational level (77%). Higher consumption of ultra-processed foods was observed in men, in those with higher schooling and in non-whites. Those who reported a frequent consumption of industrialized condiments showed a mean sodium of 4.1 ± 1.4 g/day (p = 0.03) and salt of 10.5 ± 3.6 g/day (p = 0.03). Among those who reported frequent use of industrialized condiments, a higher Na/K ratio was found and a lower ratio was observed among those with lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods. Hypertensive and those with salt intake above the recommended one presented higher Na/K ratio. Conclusion: frequent consumption of industrialized condiments is associated with higher salt excretion and Na/K ratio and higher consumption of ultraprocessed products increases Na/K ratio. © 2019 SENPE.},

abstract={Background/objectives: Health education and regulatory measures may contribute to lower population salt intake. Therefore, we aimed to describe knowledge and behaviors related to salt intake in Mozambique. Subjects/methods: A cross-sectional evaluation of a representative sample of the population aged 15–64 years (n = 3116) was conducted in 2014/2015, following the Stepwise Approach to Chronic Disease Risk Factor Surveillance, including a 12-question module for evaluation of dietary salt. Results: Three dimensions were identified in the questionnaire, named “self-reported salt intake”, “knowledge of health effects of salt intake”, and “behaviors for control of salt intake”. A total of 7.4% of the participants perceived that they consumed too much/far too much salt and 25.9% reported adding salt/salty seasoning often/always to prepared foods. The proportion considering that it was not important to decrease the salt contents of their diet was 8%, and 16.9% were not aware that high salt intake could be deleterious for health. Prevalences of lack of behaviors for reducing salt intake ranged from 74.9% for not limiting consumption of processed foods, to 95% for not buying low salt alternatives. There were few differences according to socio-demographic variables, but awareness of hypertension was, in general, associated with better knowledge and less frequent behaviors likely to contribute to a high salt intake. Conclusions: Most Mozambicans were aware that high salt intake can cause health problems, but the self-reported salt intake and behaviors for its control show an ample margin for improvement. This study provides evidence to guide population level salt-reducing policies. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background/objectives: Objective methods such as the monitoring of salt concentrations in home-prepared dishes may be effective in reducing salt intake. We investigated the effect of monitoring the salt concentration of home-prepared dishes (Monitoring) on salt reduction and change in taste threshold, and the effect of the simultaneous use of low-sodium seasonings (Seasoning) to compare the effect of Monitoring with the conventional method. Subjects/methods: We conducted a double-blind randomized controlled study using a 2 × 2 factorial design with two interventions. A total of 50 participants (40–75 years-old) were recruited among residents of Niigata Prefecture, a high sodium-consuming population in Japan, then randomly allocated to four groups. After excluding participants with incomplete urine collection, change in salt intake was evaluated using 24-hour urinary excretion as a surrogate of intake for 43 participants. Change in taste threshold was evaluated in 48 participants after excluding those with incomplete threshold measurement. Results: The Monitoring intervention group showed a significant decrease in sodium intake (−777 mg/24 h), whereas the decrease in the Seasoning intervention group was not significant (−413 mg/24 h). Sodium intake did not statistically differ between the intervention and control groups (−1011 mg/24 h and −283 mg/24 h for Monitoring and Seasoning, respectively). The changes in taste threshold measurement were very small and did not markedly differ between groups. Conclusions: Monitoring the salt concentration of dishes had a potentially stronger salt-reducing effect than the use of low-sodium seasonings, a conventional method. Confirmation requires additional study with a larger sample size. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The shell mounds (sambaquis) on the coast of Espírito Santo have received little attention in archaeological research. Despite being known to scholars since the end of the nineteenth century, shell mounds were recurrently considered marginal to the cultural developments in the neighboring state of Rio de Janeiro. Scarce information on the contents of the sites and the lack of well-referenced14C dating prevented a complete understanding of the time-depth and evolution of pre-colonial settlement on this fragment of the Brazilian coast. This paper introduces the aims and preliminary results of renewed archaeological research on the shell mounds of the northern coast of Espírito Santo, in the municipality of Linhares. Two shell mounds have been excavated thus far, pushing the record of human presence on the coast back by almost 2000 years. The new research follows a standardized method of excavation specially designed for initial characterization of shell mound deposits; this method involves creating a digital database and incorporating computerized methods for excavation management. Signs of human presence were seen along the northern coast before the Holocene maximum transgression (Suruaca site, dated c. 6800 cal. BP), when mangroves, restingas, and the Atlantic rainforest comprised the coastal environment. © 2018 Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi. All rights reserved.},

Evidence from epidemiological studies and experimental trials in animals and humans suggests that added sugars, particularly fructose, may increase blood pressure, increase heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, and participate to the metabolic inflexibility in heart. It is time for guideline committees to focus more attention to added sugar, often associated with excess of salt in industrially processed foods. A reduction in the intake of added sugars, would help to the control of hypertension, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Purpose: To describe changes in consumer knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to sodium reduction from 2012 to 2015. Design: A cross-sectional analysis using 2 online, national research panel surveys. Setting: United States. Participants: A total of 7796 adults (18+ years). Measures: Sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Analysis: Data were weighted to match the US population survey proportions using 9 factors. Wald χ2 tests were used to examine differences by survey year and hypertensive status. Results: Despite the lack of temporal changes observed in respondent characteristics (mean age: 46 years, 67% were non-Hispanic white, and 26% reported hypertension), some changes were found in the prevalence of sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. The percentage of respondents who recognized processed foods as the major source of sodium increased from 54% in 2012 to 57% in 2015 (P =.04), as did the percentage of respondents who buy or choose low/reduced sodium foods, from 33% in 2012 to 37% in 2015 (P =.016). In contrast, the percentage of self-reported receipt of health professional advice among persons with hypertension decreased from 59% in 2012 to 45% in 2015 (P &lt;.0001). Other sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors did not change significantly during 2012 to 2015. Conclusion: In recent years, some positive changes were observed in sodium-related knowledge and behaviors; however, the decrease in reported health professional advice to reduce sodium among respondents with hypertension is a concern. © 2016, The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Objectives: Sodium reduction in restaurant foods is important because 77% of sodium in the United States is consumed by eating prepared and restaurant foods. We evaluated a sodium-reduction intervention, Healthy Chinese Take-Out Initiative, among Chinese take-out restaurants in low-income neighborhoods in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Our objectives were to (1) analyze changes in the sodium content of food samples and (2) collect data on changes in chefs’ and owners’ knowledge about the health risks of sodium overconsumption, perceptions of the need for sodium reduction, self-efficacy for lowering sodium use, and perceptions of training needs for sodium-reduction strategies. Methods: The initiative trained chefs from 206 Chinese take-out restaurants on strategies to reduce sodium in prepared dishes. We analyzed changes in the sodium content of the 3 most frequently ordered dishes—shrimp and broccoli, chicken lo mein, and General Tso’s chicken—from baseline (July-September 2012) to 36 months after baseline (July-September 2015) among 40 restaurants. We conducted a survey to examine the changes in chefs’ and owners’ knowledge, perceptions, and selfefficacy of sodium reduction. We used multilevel analysis and repeated-measures analysis of variance to examine effects of the intervention on various outcomes. Results: We found significant reductions in the sodium content of all 3 dishes 36 months after a low-sodium cooking training intervention (coefficients range, –1.06 to –1.69, P < .001 for all). Mean knowledge (range, 9.2-11.1), perceptions (range, 4.6- 6.0), and self-efficacy (range, 4.2-5.9) (P < .001 for all) of sodium reduction improved significantly from baseline (August 2012) to posttraining (also August 2012), but perceptions of the need for sodium reduction and self-efficacy for lowering sodium use returned to baseline levels 36 months later (August 2015). Conclusions: The intervention was a useful population health approach that led to engaging restaurants in sodium-reduction practices. Local public health agencies and professionals could partner with independent restaurants to introduce environmental changes that can affect population health on a broad scale, particularly for vulnerable populations. © 2018, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to analyze the content of kitchen salt in bread from the bakeries in the City of Zagreb. Cooking salt or sodium chloride is one of the most common compounds on the Earth, essential for the work of human body. Along with naturally occurring sodium in foods, the main nutritional sources of sodium are industrial products (mainly bakery products and meat products), as well as adding salt during food preparation and consumption. The World Health Organization recommends daily intake of up to 5 grams of salt. Material and Methods: Bread samples from the bakeries of small craftsmen and industrial bakery manufacturers in the City of Zagreb were collected. The amount of kitchen salt in bread samples was determined by Mohr’s titration method that determines the amount of Cl-and Br-ions using the standard AgNO3 solution in neutral medium. The mean content of kitchen salt in the bread samples analyzed was 2.24%, which is almost twice the value recommended by the Croatian National Regulation on Cereals and Cereal Products (1.4%). Results: Comparison of sodium chloride in bread of local and industrial manufacturers did not show statistically signifi cant difference. In conclusion, additional efforts are needed to reduce the amount of salt in bread in order to reduce the risk of arterial hypertension and other diseases. © 2018, Academy of Medical Sciences of Croatica.

abstract={Traditional dietary management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) focuses on the quantity within the diet of energy and protein, and the restriction of single micronutrients, with little mention of dietary quality. Dietary patterns that are more plant-based, lower in meat (including processed meat), sodium and refined sugar, and have a higher content of grains and fibres are now included in multiple clinical guidelines for chronic disease prevention. The Mediterranean diet (MD) has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease incidence in both observational and interventional studies. A wealth of evidence linksMDwith other beneficial effects on chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity or cognitive health. This review examines each constituent of the classical MD and evaluates their suitability for the management of patients with CKD. We also evaluate the potential hyperkalaemia risk of increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Overall, a decrease in net endogenous acid production and increase in fibre may lead to a better control of metabolic acidosis. This, together with other putative favourable effects ofMD on endothelial function, inflammation, lipid profile and blood pressure, provide mechanistic pathways to explain the observed reduced renal function decline and improved survival in CKD patients adhering to an MD. © The Author 2017.},

abstract={Background: Sodium consumption is a modifiable risk factor for higher blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed voluntary sodium reduction goals targeting processed and commercially prepared foods. We aimed to quantify the potential health and economic impact of this policy. Methods and findings: We used a microsimulation approach of a close-to-reality synthetic population (US IMPACT Food Policy Model) to estimate CVD deaths and cases prevented or postponed, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness from 2017 to 2036 of 3 scenarios: (1) optimal, 100% compliance with 10-year reformulation targets; (2) modest, 50% compliance with 10-year reformulation targets; and (3) pessimistic, 100% compliance with 2-year reformulation targets, but with no further progress. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and high-quality meta-analyses to inform model inputs. Costs included government costs to administer and monitor the policy, industry reformulation costs, and CVD-related healthcare, productivity, and informal care costs. Between 2017 and 2036, the optimal reformulation scenario achieving the FDA sodium reduction targets could prevent approximately 450,000 CVD cases (95% uncertainty interval: 240,000 to 740,000), gain approximately 2.1 million discounted QALYs (1.7 million to 2.4 million), and produce discounted cost savings (health savings minus policy costs) of approximately $41 billion ($14 billion to $81 billion). In the modest and pessimistic scenarios, health gains would be 1.1 million and 0.7 million QALYS, with savings of $19 billion and $12 billion, respectively. All the scenarios were estimated with more than 80% probability to be cost-effective (incremental cost/QALY < $100,000) by 2021 and to become cost-saving by 2031. Limitations include evaluating only diseases mediated through BP, while decreasing sodium consumption could have beneficial effects upon other health burdens such as gastric cancer. Further, the effect estimates in the model are based on interventional and prospective observational studies. They are therefore subject to biases and confounding that may have influenced also our model estimates. Conclusions: Implementing and achieving the FDA sodium reformulation targets could generate substantial health gains and net cost savings. © 2018 Pearson-Stuttard et al.},

Diagnosis remains challenging given the high rate of false-positive high blood pressure (BP) readings at a single visit; thus, multiple visits are required to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the normative data sets used, hypertension in overweight and obese children can be underestimated by up to 20%. Specific BP targets are required for subgroups such as adolescents, children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 1 diabetes. High dietary salt intake is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

abstract={Background & aims In June 2016, South Africa implemented legislation mandating maximum sodium levels in a range of processed foods with a goal of reducing population salt intake and disease burden from hypertension. Our aim was to explore the relationship between salt and blood pressure (BP) in a subsample of the World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 2 before implementation of legislation in South Africa. Methods & results Blood pressure (BP) was measured in triplicate (n = 2722; median age 56 years; 33% male) and 24-h urine collected in a nested subsample (n = 526) for sodium, potassium and creatinine analysis. Hypertension prevalence was 55% in older adults (50-plus years) and 28% in younger adults (18–49 years). Median salt intake (6.8 g/day) was higher in younger than older adults (8.6 g vs 6.1 g/day; p < 0.001), and in urban compared to rural populations (7.0 g vs 6.0 g/day; p = 0.033). Overall, 69% of participants had salt intakes above 5 g/day. Potassium intakes were generally low (median 35 mmol/day) with significantly lower intakes in rural areas and older adults. Overall, 91% of adults failed to meet the daily potassium recommendation of 90 mmol/d. Salt intakes above 5 g/day, and to a greater extent, a dietary sodium-to-potassium (Na:K) ratio above 2 mmol/mmol, were associated with significantly steeper regression slopes of BP with age. Conclusion These preliminary results indicate that high dietary Na:K ratio may lead to a greater increase in BP and hypertension risk with age. Interventions to increase potassium intakes alongside sodium reduction initiatives may be warranted. © 2017 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University},

abstract={Background: Approximately 2 in 3 US adults have prehypertension or hypertension that increases their risk of cardiovascular disease. Reducing sodium intake can decrease blood pressure and prevent hypertension. Approximately 9 in 10 Americans consume excess sodium (≥2300 mg/d). Voluntary sodium standards for commercially processed and prepared foods were established in North America, but their impact on sodium intake is unclear. Objective: We modelled the potential impact on US sodium intake of applying voluntary sodium standards for foods. Design: We used NHANES 2007-2010 data for 17,933 participants aged ≥1 y to model predicted US daily mean sodium intake and the prevalence of excess sodium intake with the use of the standards of the New York City's National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI) and Health Canada for commercially processed and prepared foods. The Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies food codes corresponding to foods reported by NHANES participants were matched to NSRI and Health Canada food categories, and the published sales-weighted mean percent reductions were applied. Results: The US population aged ≥1 y could have reduced their usual daily mean sodium intake of 3417 mg by 698 mg (95% CI: 683, 714 mg) by applying NSRI 2014 targets and by 615 mg (95% CI: 597, 634 mg) by applying Health Canada's 2016 benchmarks. Significant reductions could have occurred, regardless of age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education, or hypertension status, up to a mean reduction in sodium intake of 850 mg/d in men aged ≥19 y by applying NSRI targets. The proportion of adults aged ≥19 y who consume≥2300 mg/d would decline from 88% (95% CI: 86%, 91%) to 71% (95% CI: 68%, 73%) by applying NSRI targets and to 74% (95% CI: 71%, 76%) by applying Health Canada benchmarks. Conclusion: If established sodium standards are applied to commercially processed and prepared foods, a significant reduction of US sodium intake could occur. © 2017 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Objective To analyse and compare the cost-effectiveness of different interventions to reduce salt consumption. Design A systematic review of published cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) and cost-utility analyses (CUA) was undertaken in the databases EMBASE, MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane and others until July 2016. Study selection was limited to CEA and CUA conducted in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in English, German or French, without time limit. Outcomes measures were life years gained (LYG), disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Relevant aspects in modelling were analysed and compared. Quality assessments were conducted using the Drummond and Jefferson/British Medical Journal checklist. Setting OECD member countries. Subjects Mainly adults. Results Fourteen CEA and CUA were included in the review which analysed different strategies: Salt reduction or substitution in processed foods, taxes, labelling, awareness campaigns and targeted dietary advice. Fifty-nine out of sixty-two scenarios were cost-saving. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in international dollars (Intl.$; 2015) was particularly low for taxes, a salt reduction by food manufacturers and labelling (<-3072 Intl.$/QALY,-6187 Intl.$/LYG and <584 Intl.$/DALY over the time horizon compared with the status quo or no intervention). Targeted dietary advice was rather not cost-effective (24 600 Intl.$/QALY and >303 900 Intl.$/DALY). However, only six studies analysed cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective and quality assessments showed flaws in conducting and a lack of transparency in reporting. Conclusions A population-wide salt reduction could be cost-effective in prevention of hypertension and CVD in OECD member countries. However, comparability between study results is limited due to differences in modelling, applied perspectives and considered data. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Background: Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies. Methods: A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each participant with special procedures, which included the collection of duplicate samples of salt added to food at the table and in home food preparation. Results: Sodium added to food outside the home was the leading source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total sodium intake in the sample. Although the proportion of sodium from this source was smaller in some subgroups, it was the leading contributor for all subgroups. Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. Sodium inherent to food was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed by salt added in home food preparation (5.6%) and salt added to food at the table (4.9%). Home tap water consumed as a beverage and dietary supplement and nonprescription antacids contributed minimally to sodium intake (<0.5% each). Conclusions: Sodium added to food outside the home accounted for ≈70% of dietary sodium intake. This finding is consistent with the 2010 Institute of Medicine recommendation for reduction of sodium in commercially processed foods as the primary strategy to reduce sodium intake in the United States.

abstract={Many factors have been causally linked to the diversification of hunting during the European Palaeolithic: declining supplies of high-ranked prey, considerable human demographic growth, reduced residential mobility, larger populations of ubiquitous small mammals and significant technological developments. However, small prey exploitation was not uniform: the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is the most frequent species in the Upper Palaeolithic archaeological record of the Iberian Peninsula – south and Mediterranean area – and Southern France. This is demonstrated at Molí del Salt, an Upper Palaeolithic site located at Vimbodí (Catalonia, Spain), whose mammal fauna stands out for the predominance of rabbits [91% of minimum number of individuals (n = 136)]. We analysed the faunal remains from one level [Asup (c. 12 700–13 000 cal BP)] in order to identify the agent responsible for the faunal accumulation, and to reconstruct aspects of procurement and consumption that shed light on Palaeolithic subsistence strategies in the Northeast Iberian Peninsula. Our results indicate that human agency rather than carnivore activity was responsible for the bone accumulation at Molí del Salt. We identified all the stages in the consumption sequence from skinning to ingestion. We argue that the rabbits were mostly harvested during summer or winter or both seasons. Clearly, the European rabbit was a target species for the human groups which lived at Molí del Salt providing meat, and skin. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

abstract={Purpose: Previous studies have reported improvements in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors with the consumption of raw nuts. However, around one-third of nuts consumed are roasted and salted. Thus, it is important to determine whether roasting and salting nuts affect the health benefits observed with raw nuts. This study aimed to compare the effects of consuming two different forms of hazelnuts on cardiovascular risk factors and acceptance. Methods: Using a randomised crossover design, 72 participants were asked to consume 30 g/day of either raw or dry roasted, lightly salted hazelnuts for 28 days each. CVD risk factors were measured at the beginning and end of each treatment period. “Desire to consume” and “overall liking” for both forms of hazelnuts were assessed daily using a 150-mm visual analogue scale. Results: Body composition, blood pressure, plasma total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1 and B100, glucose and α-tocopherol concentrations did not differ between forms of hazelnuts (all P ≥ 0.054). High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (P = 0.037) and triacylglycerol (P < 0.001) concentrations were significantly lower following the consumption of dry roasted, lightly salted hazelnuts when compared to the raw hazelnuts. Compared with baseline, consuming both forms of hazelnuts significantly improved HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 concentrations, total-C/HDL-C ratio, and systolic blood pressure without significantly changing body composition. Acceptance ratings did not differ between forms of hazelnuts and remained high throughout the study. Conclusion: Dry roasting and lightly salting nuts do not appear to negate the cardioprotective effects observed with raw nut consumption, and both forms of nuts are resistant to monotony. Public health messages could be extended to include dry roasted and lightly salted nuts as part of a heart healthy diet. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background: Dietary risks today constitute the largest proportion of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally and in Sweden. An increasing number of people today consume highly processed foods high in saturated fat, refined sugar and salt and low in dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals. It is important that dietary trends over time are monitored to predict changes in disease risk. Methods: In total, 15,995 individuals with two visits 10 (±1) years apart in the population-based Västerbotten Intervention Programme 1996-2014 were included. Dietary intake was captured with a 64-item food frequency questionnaire. Percent changes in intake of dietary components, Healthy Diet Score and Dietary Inflammatory Index were calculated and related to body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and blood pressure at the second visit in multivariable regression analyses. Results: For both sexes, on group level, proportion of energy intake (E%) from carbohydrates and sucrose decreased (largest carbohydrate decrease among 40 year-olds) and E% protein and total fat as well as saturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) increased (highest protein increase among 30 year-olds and highest fat increase among 60 year-olds) over the 10-year period. Also, E% trans-fatty acids decreased. On individual basis, for both sexes decreases in intake of cholesterol and trans-fatty acids were associated with lower BMI and serum cholesterol at second visit (all P < 0.05). For men, increases in intake of whole grain and Healthy Diet Score were associated with lower BMI and serum cholesterol at second visit (all P < 0.05). Also for men, decreases in intake of trans-fatty acids and increases in Healthy Diet Score were associated with lower systolic blood pressure at second visit (P = 0.002 and P < 0.000). For women, increases in intake of PUFA and Healthy Diet Score were associated with lower BMI at second visit (P = 0.01 and P < 0.05). Surprisingly, increases in intake of sucrose among women were associated with lower BMI at second visit (P = 0.02). Conclusions: In this large population-based sample, dietary changes over 10 years towards less carbohydrates and more protein and fat were noted. Individual changes towards the Nordic dietary recommendations were associated with healthier cardio-metabolic risk factor profile at second visit. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={IMPORTANCE In the United States, national associations of individual dietary factors with specific cardiometabolic diseases are not well established. OBJECTIVE To estimate associations of intake of 10 specific dietary factors with mortality due to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (cardiometabolic mortality) among US adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A comparative risk assessment model incorporated data and corresponding uncertainty on population demographics and dietary habits from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999-2002: n = 8104; 2009-2012: n = 8516); estimated associations of diet and disease from meta-analyses of prospective studies and clinical trials with validity analyses to assess potential bias; and estimated disease-specific national mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics. EXPOSURES Consumption of 10 foods/nutrients associated with cardiometabolic diseases: Fruits, vegetables, nuts/seeds, whole grains, unprocessed red meats, processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), polyunsaturated fats, seafood omega-3 fats, and sodium. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated absolute and percentage mortality due to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes in 2012. Disease-specific and demographic-specific (age, sex, race, and education) mortality and trends between 2002 and 2012 were also evaluated. RESULTS In 2012, 702 308 cardiometabolic deaths occurred in US adults, including 506 100 from heart disease (371 266 coronary heart disease, 35 019 hypertensive heart disease, and 99 815 other cardiovascular disease), 128 294 from stroke (16 125 ischemic, 32 591 hemorrhagic, and 79 578 other), and 67 914 from type 2 diabetes. Of these, an estimated 318 656 (95%uncertainty interval [UI], 306 064-329 755; 45.4%) cardiometabolic deaths per year were associated with suboptimal intakes-48.6%(95%UI, 46.2%-50.9%) of cardiometabolic deaths in men and 41.8%(95%UI, 39.3%-44.2%) in women; 64.2%(95% UI, 60.6%-67.9%) at younger ages (25-34 years) and 35.7%(95%UI, 33.1%-38.1%) at older ages (-75 years); 53.1%(95%UI, 51.6%-54.8%) among blacks, 50.0%(95%UI, 48.2%-51.8%) among Hispanics, and 42.8%(95%UI, 40.9%-44.5%) among whites; and 46.8%(95%UI, 44.9%-48.7%) among lower-, 45.7%(95%UI, 44.2%-47.4%) among medium-, and 39.1%(95%UI, 37.2%-41.2%) among higher-educated individuals. The largest numbers of estimated diet-related cardiometabolic deaths were related to high sodium (66 508 deaths in 2012; 9.5%of all cardiometabolic deaths), low nuts/seeds (59 374; 8.5%), high processed meats (57 766; 8.2%), low seafood omega-3 fats (54 626; 7.8%), low vegetables (53 410; 7.6%), low fruits (52 547; 7.5%), and high SSBs (51 694; 7.4%). Between 2002 and 2012, population-adjusted US cardiometabolic deaths per year decreased by 26.5%. The greatest decline was associated with insufficient polyunsaturated fats (-20.8% relative change [95%UI,-18.5%to-22.8%]), nuts/seeds (-18.0%[95%UI,-14.6%to-21.0%]), and excess SSBs (-14.5%[95%UI,-12.0% to-16.9%]). The greatest increase was associated with unprocessed red meats (+14.4%[95%UI, 9.1%-19.5%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dietary factors were estimated to be associated with a substantial proportion of deaths from heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. These results should help identify priorities, guide public health planning, and inform strategies to alter dietary habits and improve health. © 2017 American Medical Association.},

abstract={Aim. To assess quantitative macroelement contents of kidney tissue in arterial hypertension (AH) patients. Material and methods. By the method of nephrobiopsy, in AH patients (n=12, duration of AH 6,3±1,5 y.) during surgery on upper urinary tract, specimens were collected of biological tissue of kidney. As the controls, elements in kidney tissue of healthy persons were studied, from those died in traffic accidents (n=18). Mean age of the patients was 48,3±1,6 y. o. By the method of atom-emission spectrometry with nanotechnologies: scanning (SEM; FEI Quanta 200, FEI Quanta 600) and scanning transmission electronic microscopy (STEM; FEI Nova NanoSEM) the contents of macroelements and microelements were assessed. Results. It was found that concentration of atomic C in AH patients comparing to control group shows tendency to increase, exceeding the controls by 9%. In AH patients kidney tissue shows significant decrease of all main elements (N, O, Na, Mg, P, S, Cl, K, Zn). Conclusion. Further study on the mechanisms of AH development with evaluation of chemical elements concentration directly in the tissues where do chemical reactions act, is important for understanding of the grade of involvement of specific organs into these processes. Creation of database of overall element contents of biological tissues is a novel direction in cardiology. The results of elements assessment of kidney tissue in cardiovascular diseases will open new opportunities for treatment and target organ damage prevention. © 2017, Silicea-Poligraf.

abstract={BACKGROUND Some available evidence suggests that high consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is associated with a higher risk of obesity. Collectively, this association and the nutritional characteristics of UPFs suggest that UPFs might also be associated with hypertension. METHODS We prospectively evaluated the relationship between UPF consumption and the risk of hypertension in a prospective Spanish cohort, the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra project. We included 14,790 Spanish adult university graduates who were initially free of hypertension at baseline who were followed for a mean of 9.1 years (SD, 3.9 years; total personyears: 134,784). UPF (industrial formulations of chemical compounds which, beyond substances of common culinary use such as salt, sugar, oils, and fats, include substances also derived from foods but not used in culinary preparations) consumption was assessed using a validated semiquantitative 136-item food-frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confdence intervals (CIs) for hypertension incidence. RESULTS During follow-up, 1,702 incident cases of hypertension were identifed. Participants in the highest tertile of UPF consumption had a higher risk of developing hypertension (adjusted HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06, 1.37; P for trend = 0.004) than those in the lowest tertile after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS In this large prospective cohort of Spanish middle-aged adult university graduates, a positive association between UPF consumption and hypertension risk was observed. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to confrm our results. © 2017 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has a high prevalence around the world. Considering the components used to classify MetS, it is clear that it is closely related to obesity. These two conditions begin with an increase in abdominal adipose tissue, which is metabolically more active, containing a greater amount of resident macrophages compared to other fat deposits. Abdominal adiposity promotes in?ammation and oxidative stress, which are precursors of various complications involving MetS components, namely insulin resistance, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. One way to block the effects of oxidative stress would be through the antioxidant defense system, which offsets the excess free radicals. It is known that individuals with metabolic syndrome and obesity have high consumption of fats and sugars originated from processed foods containing high levels of sodium as well as low intake of fruits and vegetables, thus maintaining a state of oxidative stress, that can speed up the onset of MetS. Healthy eating habits could prevent or delay MetS by adding antioxidant-rich foods into the diet.},

abstract={Introduction Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among African Americans in the U.S., with high blood pressure and obesity being two of the main determinants. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet is effective in changing behaviors associated with these health concerns, but has not been adapted to community settings. Methods Men on the Move: Growing Communities (MOTMGC) was evaluated using a quasi-experimental cross-sectional design. Surveys were conducted with rural African Americans aged ≥18 years prior to the intervention (2008) and at the end of the project (2013), with the final analysis conducted in 2015. Using a community-based participatory research approach, MOTMGC provided culturally appropriate education and changes to the environment to improve access to fruits and vegetables, low-fat, and low-sodium foods. Results Declines in prevalence of overweight and obese respondents and hypertension were seen in the intervention but not the comparison county. Participants with high levels of participation reported eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day, a greater variety of fruits and vegetables, less salt, and seasoning their vegetables with less fat more often than those who did not participate in educational activities. Participants reported that as a result of their access to MOTMGC gardens, they were more likely to eat more fruits, vegetables, and locally grown food, and less processed food and fast food. Conclusions Adapting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet to community settings through culturally appropriate community-based efforts can improve dietary behaviors, BMI, and blood pressure. © 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine},

abstract={In Iran, as in most countries, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death (highest mortality rate), but rank third in terms of disease burden. On the other hand, the relationship between high salt intake, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease has been proven. Food consumption pattern in Iran shows that consumption of salt, pickled foods and salty snacks is common. Regarding the World Health Organization (WHO) target for salt intake (about 5 g per day), the evidence indicates that Iranian people consume 2-3 times more than the recommended amount of salt. Fortunately, serious attention has been paid to this matter since 2009 and along with arrangements for it, support of all relevant sectors (public and private) has been included in the agenda. At present, reduction of salt intake is among the major priorities of planners, policy makers, and experts of the Iranian health services system. On the other hand, many studies in EMRO have shown high levels of daily salt intake in these countries. In this review, the solutions used in the Islamic Republic of Iran at various levels were considered, including determination of salt intake measurement methods, revision in the amount of salt in processed food products, food labeling, promoting awareness of various social groups, gathering support from all relevant sectors, designing a regular public awareness campaign for reducing salt intake, and lessons learned in this regard, that can be helpful to countries in the region. © 2016, Academy of Medical Sciences of I.R.

abstract={Background and aims: Both a high dietary sodium and high phosphate load are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and possibly also in non-CKD populations. Sodium and phosphate are abundantly present in processed food. We hypothesized that (modulation of) dietary sodium is accompanied by changes in phosphate load across populations with normal and impaired renal function. Methods and Results: We first investigated the association between sodium and phosphate load in 24-h urine samples from healthy controls (n = 252), patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM, n = 255) and renal transplant recipients (RTR, n = 705). Secondly, we assessed the effect of sodium restriction on phosphate excretion in a nondiabetic CKD cohort (ND-CKD: n = 43) and a diabetic CKD cohort (D-CKD: n = 39). Sodium excretion correlated with phosphate excretion in healthy controls (R = 0.386, P < 0.001), DM (R = 0.490, P < 0.001), and RTR (R = 0.519, P < 0.001). This correlation was also present during regular sodium intake in the intervention studies (ND-CKD: R = 0.491, P < 0.001; D-CKD: R = 0.729, P < 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, sodium excretion remained significantly correlated with phosphate excretion after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, and eGFR in all observational cohorts. In ND-CKD and D-CKD moderate sodium restriction reduced phosphate excretion (31 ± 10 to 28 ± 10 mmol/d; P = 0.04 and 26 ± 11 to 23 ± 9 mmol/d; P = 0.02 respectively). Conclusions: Dietary exposure to sodium and phosphate are correlated across the spectrum of renal function impairment. The concomitant reduction in phosphate intake accompanying sodium restriction underlines the off-target effects on other nutritional components, which may contribute to the beneficial cardiovascular effects of sodium restriction.(f) Registration numbers: Dutch Trial Register NTR675, NTR2366. © 2016.},

abstract={Background/Aim. Data on sodium intake and sources of sodium in the diet in Serbia are limited. The aim of this study was to estimate the sodium intake and identify the sources of sodium in the diet of undergraduate students attending the University of Novi Sad. Methods. Students completed a questionnaire to gather data on their gender, age and university faculty attended, and then a 24 h dietary recall. The sodium intake of the students was calculated using the dietary recall data and data on the sodium content of foods. The contribution of different food groups as well as of specific foodstuffs to the total sodium intake was calculated. Results. The mean estimated sodium intake of the students was 3,938.5 ± 1,708.1 mg/day. The sodium intake of 89.1% of the surveyed students exceeded the guideline for sodium intake, the majority of the sodium coming from processed foods (78.9% of the total sodium intake). The food groups that contributed the most to the total sodium intake of the students were meat and meat products (21.7%) and cereals and cereal-based products (18.6%). Bread and other bakery products were responsible for 13.1% of the total sodium intake. Conclusion. High sodium intake in students of the University of Novi Sad puts them at high risk of developing high blood pressure. The food industry should work towards reformulating products with high sodium content, especially bread and other bakery products. Efforts should be taken to reduce sodium intake among undergraduate students in Novi Sad. © 2016, Institut za Vojnomedicinske Naucne Informacije/Documentaciju. All rights reserved.},

Currently, the developed rules examines the side effects that are causing some health risks: heart disease, diabetes, allergy, and asthma as initial. There are thousands compounds added to the processed food by food producers with numerous effects on the food: to add color, stabilize, texturize, preserve, sweeten, thicken, add flavor, soften, emulsify, and so forth. Those commonly used ingredients or compounds in manufactured foods may have many side effects that cause several health risks such as heart disease, hypertension, cholesterol, asthma, diabetes, allergies, alzheimer etc. according to World Health Organization. Safety in food consumption, especially by patients in these risk groups, has become crucial, given that such health problems are ranked in the top ten health risks around the world. It is needed personal e-health knowledge base systems to help patients take control of their safe food consumption. The systems with advanced semantic knowledge base can provide recommendations of appropriate foods before consumption by individuals. The proposed FoodWiki system is using a concept based search mechanism that performs on thousands food compounds to provide more relevant information. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Optimal diabetic compensation is essential for prevention and treatment of CHF. A wide range of antidiabetic drugs can lower effectively blood glucose as well as improve cardiovascular parameters. Metformin - traditional antidiabetic drug is a very effective insulin sensitizer with positive cardiovascular effect; metformin can be used in patients with compensated CHF. Gliptins, modern peroral antidiabetic drugs, are used in patients with cardiovascular complications however results of recent cardiovascular studies (SAVOR, TECOS, EXAMINE) were a bit confusing. Gliflozines on the other hand have become very promising for patients with CHF, based on results of EMPA-REG presenting statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and complications of chronic heart failure.},

abstract={Background: Salt consumption activates the brain reward system, inducing cravings and the search for salted food. Its excessive intake is associated with high blood pressure and obesity. The high quantity of salt in processed food is most likely a major cause of the global pandemic of hypertension (HT). Objective: To review the current information on the topic of salt addiction and the health consequences this has. Method: A search in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and EBSCOhost databases was conducted with the keywords "salt", "salt addiction", and "food addiction". Articles with information relative to the topic of interest were checked, as were references of those articles and historical and culturally complementary information. Results: We described the historical relationship between man and salt, the physiology of salty taste perception, its role in the reward system and the health consequences of a high sodium diet. Discussion and conclusion: There is physiological and behavioural evidence that some people may develop a true addiction to food. Among these people, salt addiction seems to be of great importance in the development of obesity, HT and other diseases. Sodium is present in high quantities in processed food as salt and monosodium glutamate (MSG), used as flavour enhancers and food preservatives, including in non-salty foods like bread and soft drinks.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study was to provide baseline estimates of sodium levels in 125 popular, sodium-contributing, commercially processed and restaurant foods in the U.S., to assess future changes as manufacturers reformulate foods. Methods: In 2010-2013, we obtained ~ 5200 sample units from up to 12 locations and analyzed 1654 composites for sodium and related nutrients (potassium, total dietary fiber, total and saturated fat, and total sugar), as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture-led sodium-monitoring program. We determined sodium content as mg/100 g, mg/serving, and mg/kcal and compared them against U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) sodium limits for "low" and "healthy" claims and to the optimal sodium level of < 1.1 mg/kcal, extrapolating from the Healthy Eating Index-2010. Results: Results from this study represent the baseline nutrient values to use in assessing future changes as foods are reformulated for sodium reduction. Sodium levels in over half (69 of 125) of the foods, including all main dishes and most Sentinel Foods from fast-food outlets or restaurants (29 of 33 foods), exceeded the FDA sodium limit for using the claim "healthy". Only 13 of 125 foods had sodium values below 1.1 mg/kcal. We observed a wide range of sodium content among similar food types and brands. Conclusions: Current sodium levels in commercially processed and restaurant foods in the U.S. are high and variable. Targeted benchmarks and increased awareness of high sodium content and variability in foods would support reduction of sodium intakes in the U.S. © 2015.},

abstract={Background: Excess salt intake is a global issue. Effective salt-reduction strategies are needed, however, as salt is a vehicle for iodine fortification, these strategies may also reduce iodine intake. This study examines the case of the remote Indigenous Australian population; we employed an innovative, objective method to assess sodium and iodine intakes against requirements and modelled the potential effects of salt-reduction strategies on estimated sodium and iodine intakes. Design: Store-sales data were collected from 20 remote Indigenous community stores in 2012-14 representing the main source of food for 2 years for ~8300 individuals. Estimated average sodium and iodine intakes were compared against recommendations (nutrient reference values weighted to age and gender distribution). Linear programming was employed to simulate potential effects of salt-reduction strategies on estimated sodium and iodine intakes. Results: Estimated average sodium intake was 2770 (range within communities 2410-3450) mg/day, far exceeding the population-weighted upper limit (2060 mg/day). Discretionary (added) salt, bread and processed meat were the biggest contributors providing 46 % of all sodium. Estimated average iodine intake was within recommendations at 206 (186-246) μg/day. The following scenarios enabled modelling of estimated average salt intake to within recommendations: 1) 67 % reduction in sodium content of bread and discretionary salt intake, 2) 38 % reduction in sodium content of all processed foods, 3) 30 % reduction in sodium content of all processed foods and discretionary salt intake. In all scenarios, simulated average iodine intakes remained within recommendations. Conclusions: Salt intakes of the remote Indigenous Australian population are far above recommendations, likely contributing to the high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular mortality experienced by this population. Salt-reduction strategies could considerably reduce salt intake in this population without increasing risk of iodine deficiency at the population-level. These data add to the global evidence informing salt-reduction strategies and the evidence that these strategies can be synergistically implemented with iodine deficiency elimination programmes.

abstract={High salt intake is now endemic worldwide. It contributes to the generation and maintenance of high blood pressure, which is now the biggest risk factor for global disease. There is now compelling evidence to support salt reduction in hypertensives and a substantial body of evidence to support salt reduction in the general population to reduce risk of death from cardiovascular disease. In specific diseases such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease, guidelines support the World Health Organization target for reduced salt intake at 5 g daily. Achieving a diet that is lower in salt has challenges, but is more likely to be achieved through salt reduction strategies particularly focused on processed food and through educational programs. To be effective, these interventions require collaboration between industry, health agencies and governments. © Royal College of Physicians 2015. All rights reserved.},

For Germany, so far, no valid biomarker-based data on current daily salt intake are available. Methods: Data basis for this biomarker-based estimation of salt intake in the German population was the representative DEGS Study (German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults) conducted 2008–2011 in 18–79 old adults living in Germany. Daily salt intake was estimated from 6,962 sodium and creatinine measurements in spot urine samples. Results: Median estimated daily salt intake of the 18–79 olds was 10.0 g in men and 8.4 g in women. More than 75 % of men and about 70 % of women exceeded the current recommendation of a maximum salt intake of 6 g/day. Fifty percentage of men and more than 35 % of the women had a daily salt intake >10 g. Conclusion: Daily salt intake of the German population considerably exceeds the current recommendation to eat no more than 6 g salt per day. A general reduction of salt content in processed foods—which are currently the main source of salt intake—offers a promising and cost-effective potential for the improvement of all salt intake-dependent health outcomes in the population. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of hypertension relevant nutrition knowledge on practices for prevention of hypertension in Chinese college students studying in South Korea. Methods: We conducted a survey of 276 Chinese students studying more than three months in Korean universities who were aged 19 and older about hypertension and sodium relevant nutrition knowledge, intake of salty processed food, hypertension prevention practices, and stages of behavior change for hypertension. Results: The average score on the questionnaire for hypertension relevant nutritional knowledge was 40.62 out of 50 points, and the average score for sodium relevant nutritional knowledge was 24 out of 30 points. Kimchi was the most frequently eaten salty processed food. The average score for hypertension prevention practices was 3.10 out of 5 points. The behavior change stages for prevention of hypertension were contemplation (47.1%), action (32.2%), and pre-contemplation (20.7%). The students received high scores on nutrition knowledge and showed significantly higher scores on the action stage than on pre-contemplation or contemplation. Nutritional knowledge of hypertension and sodium showed positive correlation with hypertension prevention practices, whereas negative correlation with salty processed food intake. Conclusion: Development of an education program for Chinese students in Korea on hypertension and sodium relevant nutritional knowledge is needed so that they can practice for prevention of hypertension. © 2015 The Korean Nutrition Society.},

abstract={Food by definition consists of protein, carbohydrate, and fat used by the body to sustain growth, maintain, and support vital processes. Snack foods are considered healthy if they have less fats and less salt. Snacks, as they become part of regular meal, have a major role in everyday diet. Snacks that have no nutritional value are considered as junk. Consumption of these unhealthy snacks can result in obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Research data have discovered that junk snack food is one of the prime reasons for obesity among people in developed countries. There is growing awareness among consumers in the developed countries to eat healthier and more natural snacks. Among the different food processing technologies, extrusion is a versatile technology that can be used for making healthier snacks. Extrusion cooking helps to reduce the antinutritional factors in food, increases the nutritional stability, and creates new products using traditional and novel ingredients. Extrusion system helps to develop third-generation snacks that are nutrient-rich and result in a product with long shelf life and high bulk density and can be transported long distances more cost-effectively. These extruded products can be consumed by frying, microwaving, or hot-air frying. Currently, snack industries are using enrichment and fortification methods that improve the nutritive value and are also focusing on using salt replacements and mono- and polyunsaturated fats to create healthier snacks. Many health agencies are recommending to the consumer to eat healthier snacks that are more plenty in fruits and vegetables. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Introduction: Dietary salt reduction of Americans has been a focus of public health initiatives for more than 40 years primarily due to the association between high salt intake and development of hypertension. Despite past efforts, salt intake of Americans has remained at levels well above dietary recommendations, likely due in part to the hedonic appeal of salty taste. As such, in 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) suggested a strategy of gradual salt reduction of processed foods, the primary source of Americans’ dietary salt intake, via an approach intended to minimize its impact on consumer acceptability of lower-sodium foods. Methods: This brief review discusses the ontogeny and development of human salty taste preference, the role of experience in shifting salt preference, and sources of dietary salt. Our current understanding of shifting human salty taste preference is discussed within the context of potential opportunities and challenges in reducing salt intake of Americans via the IOM’s suggested strategy. Results: Gaps in the research that both limit our ability to predict effectiveness of gradual salt reduction and that need be addressed before a strategy to shift salt preference can realistically be implemented were identified. Conclusions: Our current understanding of shifting salt preference suggests that a strategy focused on reducing salt in processed foods has potential for success due to the strong association between salt intake and preference; however, because the IOM’s strategy has not been tested directly, effectiveness remains unresolved. Implications: It may be imprudent to extrapolate from existing relatively short-term studies to conclude that gradually reducing salt in the food supply would be effective for both reducing salt intake and salt preference of a national population. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Introduction: the relationship between early feeding and blood pressure in later life is still uncertain and sometimes contradictory. Some studies point to the protective effect of breastfeeding on cardiovascular disease, while others do not obtain conclusive results. Objectives: the aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between breastfeeding patterns during the first months of life and blood pressure in childhood, in two samples of children from two populations with different socio-cultural characteristics, controlling for quality feeding in infancy. Methods: the study, with a transversal and retrospective design, was conducted with 492 schoolchildren aged between 8 and 10 years, it consists of two samples, both collected from public schools, one in Madrid (Spain) and one in Vitoria, Espirito Santo (Brazil). Results: ninety percent of the sample was breastfed, 196 (44.2%) from Madrid and 247 (55.7%) from Vitória/ES. The average duration of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in Madrid was 12.89 weeks (std = 9.6) and in Vitória/ES, 22.00 weeks (std = 13.4), with statistically significant differences. The mean values of systolic and dyastolic blood pressure, were significantly higher in the Brazilian sample. The prevalences of borderline hypertension and hypertension were also higher in Brazil than in Spanish, 68% vs 32% and 60% vs 40%, respectively. Association between shorter duration of EBF and higher prevalence of hypertension in childhood, was observed in the two samples. Regarding the association between diet quality and blood pressure values, this was only significant in the Brazilian sample, but not in Spanish. Discussion: in both samples a protective effect of breastfeeding on blood pressure was observed, however when comparing the two samples appear to be a contradiction since the Brazilian children were breastfed for longer than the Spaniards but their Pressure Arterial values and the Hypertension prevalence were higher in the Spanish sample. This contradiction is resolved by controlling the effect of feeding in infancy. The food quality of Brazilian children is worse than that of Spaniards, mainly due to a higher consumption of processed foods very high in sodium content. Conclusion: the possible protective effect of breastfeeding, is reduced at later stages of the life cycle if food habit are not appropriate or do not meet minimum quality requirements. Therefore, although breastfeeding plays an important role in preventing the development of hypertension in children is not enough to support the practice of breastfeeding but prevention work is ongoing and should insist on eating habits and promote healthy lifestyles throughout the entire life cycle of people. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

abstract={The current Western diet figures centrally in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and the emerging major health problem nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, all of them negatively impacting on life expectancy. This type of diet is represented by a high calorie uptake, high glycemic load, high fat and meat intake, as well as increased consumption of fructose. On the contrary, a simplified way of eating healthily by excluding highly-processed foods, is presumed to be the Paleolithic diet (a diet based on vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, meat, organ meats) which improves insulin resistance, ameliorates dyslipidemia, reduces hypertension and may reduce the risk of age-related diseases. The diet is the foundation of the treatment of obesity- and type 2 diabetes-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and a diet similar to those of pre-agricultural societies may be an effective option. To lend sufficient credence to this type of diet, well-designed studies are needed. © 2015, Romanian Journal of Gastroenterology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The antecedents of elevated blood pressure (BP) and its major consequences (cardiovascular disease and stroke) begin in childhood. Higher levels of BP early in life track into adulthood and are associated with subclinical target organ damage in children and adults. Diet behaviors, including the choice of high sodium containing foods, are established during childhood. On average, children, ages 2-19, consume more than 3,100 mg of sodium per day, with substantially greater sodium intakes in boys than girls. Importantly, studies show that lowering sodium intake in children lowers blood pressure. In view of this evidence, US Dietary Guidelines recommend a reduced sodium intake in children. Current federal nutrition standards include a step-wise reduction in the sodium levels of school meals. The ultimate goal is to help children achieve daily sodium intakes that do not exceed upper levels recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In summary, available data are sufficiently strong to recommend a lower sodium intake beginning in early in life as an effective and well-tolerated approach to reducing BP in children. Current efforts to weaken nutrition standards for school meals undermine an effective strategy aimed at improving the health of our children and our nation. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by enzyme α-galactosidase A deficiency as a result of mutations in the GLA gene. Cardiac involvement is characterized by progressive left ventricular hypertrophy.Objective: To estimate the prevalence of Fabry disease in a population with left ventricular hypertrophy.Methods: The patients were assessed for the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy defined as a left ventricular mass index ≥ 96 g/m2 for women or ≥ 116 g/m2 for men. Severe aortic stenosis and arterial hypertension with mild left ventricular hypertrophy were exclusion criteria. All patients included were assessed for enzyme α-galactosidase A activity using dry spot testing. Genetic study was performed whenever the enzyme activity was decreased.Results: A total of 47 patients with a mean left ventricular mass index of 141.1 g/m2 (± 28.5; 99.2 to 228.5 g/m2] were included. Most of the patients were females (51.1%). Nine (19.1%) showed decreased α-galactosidase A activity, but only one positive genetic test − [GLA] c.785G&gt;T; p.W262L (exon 5), a mutation not previously described in the literature. This clinical investigation was able to establish the association between the mutation and the clinical presentation.Conclusion: In a population of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, we documented a Fabry disease prevalence of 2.1%. This novel case was defined in the sequence of a mutation of unknown meaning in the GLA gene with further pathogenicity study. Thus, this study permitted the definition of a novel causal mutation for Fabry disease – [GLA] c.785G&gt;T; p.W262L (exon 5). © 2015, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Globally, excess salt intake is a significant cause of preventable heart disease and stroke, given the established links between high salt intake, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. This paper describes and evaluates the voluntary approaches to salt reduction that operate in the United Kingdom and the United States, and proposes a new strategy for improving their performance. Drawing on developments in the theory and practice of public health governance, as well as theoretical ideas from the field of regulatory studies, this paper proposes a responsive regulatory model for managing food reformulation initiatives, including salt reduction programs. This model provides a transparent framework for guiding industry behavior, making full use of industry's willingness to participate in efforts to create healthier products, but using 'legislative scaffolding' to escalate from self-regulation towards co-regulation if industry fails to play its part in achieving national goals and targets. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Reducing dietary salt/sodium is one of the most cost-effective interventions to improve population health. There are five initiatives in the Americas that independently developed targets for reformulating foods to reduce salt/sodium content. Applying selection criteria, recommended by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Technical Advisory Group on Dietary Salt/Sodium Reduction, a consortium of governments, civil society, and food companies (the Salt Smart Consortium) agreed to an inaugural set of regional maximum targets (upper limits) for salt/sodium levels for 11 food categories, to be achieved by December 2016. Ultimately, to substantively reduce dietary salt across whole populations, targets will be needed for the majority of processed and pre-prepared foods. Cardiovascular and hypertension organizations are encouraged to utilize the regional targets in advocacy and in monitoring and evaluation of progress by the food industry. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Introduction: The diagnosis of hypertension in children has a prevalence of about 2-3%. There are modifiable risk factors such as healthy lifestyles, which have proven to be effective in reducing blood pressure levels. For the purpose of this study the concentrations of NaCl and K in pediatric nutrition were studied. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the use of sodium chloride and potassium in the nutrition received by a group of hospitalized patients from 0-15 years old, receiving normal diet and compare it with the normal expected value. Depending on the study results, the concentration will be modified to reach the recommended concetrations for age. Also we will elaborate an education program for parents. Method: A cross-sectional observational study, was conducted between March and November 2013, where the sodium chloride and potassium concentrations in the diet received by infants and children hospitalized in the pediatric unit of Clinic Las Condes were measured and compared with those recommended for each age group. Twenty samples collected for five consecutive days were analyzed. Measures were performed by atomic absorption. Foods studied were divided in four age groups. Those measurements were performed blind to the age grupo. Results: The concentration of NaCl in all age groups was higher than the recommended and the K concentration was less than the recomendad. There were statistically significant differences between expected and observed values in intake of sodium chloride and potasium in all groups. Conclusion: Increased sodium chloride due to the use of processed foods. It was replaced by natural foods so will be able to reach the expected values. Low potassium intake was corrected by increasing the supply of fruits and vegetables. © 2015},

abstract={Background/Aims: National and international agencies recommend a reduction in dietary sodium intake. However, some have questioned the wisdom of these policies. The goal of this report was to assess the findings and quality of studies that have examined the relationship between dietary sodium and both blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Methods: Literature review of the available observational studies and randomized controlled trials, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Results: A large body of evidence from observational studies and clinical trials documents a direct relationship between dietary sodium intake and the level of blood pressure, especially in persons with a higher level of blood pressure, African-Americans, and those who are older or have comorbidity, including chronic kidney disease. A majority of the available observational reports support the presence of a direct relationship between dietary sodium intake and cardiovascular disease but the quality of the evidence according to most studies is poor. The limited information available from clinical trials is consistent with a beneficial effect of reduced sodium intake on incidence of cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: The scientific underpinning for policies to reduce the usual intake of dietary sodium is strong. In the United States and many other countries, addition of sodium during food processing has led to a very high average intake of dietary sodium, with almost everyone exceeding the recommended goals. National programs utilizing voluntary and mandatory approaches have resulted in a successful reduction in sodium intake. Even a small reduction in sodium consumption is likely to yield sizable improvement in population health. Video Journal Club 'Cappuccino with Claudio Ronco' at www.karger.com/?doi=368975. © 2015 S.

abstract={Background/Objectives:The relationship between sodium intake and arterial blood pressure (BP) values in adolescence is still controversial. The intake of high-sodium processed foods as snacks has gone up worldwide. The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to analyze the association between BP values and sodium intake from snacks.Subjects/Methods:The mean weekly consumption of snacks was evaluated in 1200 randomly selected adolescents aged 11-13 years by a food-frequency questionnaire; their anthropometric and BP values were measured by trained researchers. A dietary 24-h food-recall questionnaire was randomly given to 400 of the 1200 adolescents.Results:Mean sodium intake from snacks was 1.4 g/day. Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP, respectively) significantly increased from the lower to the higher tertile of sodium from snacks and with increasing frequency of salty snacks consumption. In a multiple logistic regression model, both being in the highest SBP quartile and in the highest DBP quartile were significantly associated with the intake of sodium from snacks (odds ratio (OR)=1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.91 and OR=2.17; 95% CI 1.68-2.79, respectively), the consumption of >2/day salty snacks (OR=1.86; 95% CI 1.32-2.63 and OR=2.38; 95% CI 1.69-3.37, respectively) and body mass index (OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.22-1.31 and OR=1.14; 95% CI 1.10-1.18, respectively) but not with age, sex or exercise levels. In the 400 individuals, the average total sodium intake was 3.1 g/day and was significantly higher in individuals belonging to the highest quartile of SBP and DBP.Conclusions:Sodium intake from snacks was almost half of the average daily sodium consumption and was significantly associated with BP values in adolescents. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={Background: Prevalence of high blood pressure has been increasing in U.S. children, with implications for long term health consequences. Sodium consumption, a modifiable risk factor for high blood pressure, is above recommended limits and increasing. Very little is known about Latino caregiver beliefs and behaviors around their children's salt consumption. Methods: In California's Central Valley, qualitative interviews in Spanish investigated low-income caregivers' views and understandings of their children's dietary salt consumption. Thirty individual interviews and 5 focus groups were conducted (N=61). Interview transcripts were translated and transcribed, coded and thematically analyzed. Results: Seven primary topic areas around children's salt intake and its impact on health were identified: children's favorite foods, children's dietary salt sources, superiority of home-cooked foods, salty and sweet foods, managing salt for health, developing children's tastes, and adding salt added at the table. Parents recognize common sources of sodium such as "junk food" and processed food and made efforts to limit their children's consumption of these foods, but may overlook other significant sodium sources, particularly bread, cheese, prepared soups and sports drinks. Caregivers recognize excess salt as unhealthy for children, but don't believe health problems (like high blood pressure) can occur in young children. Nevertheless, they made efforts to limit how much salt their children consumed through a variety of strategies; school meals were a source of high sodium that they felt were outside of their control. Conclusion: Latino caregivers are concerned about their children's salt intake and attempt to limit consumption, but some common sources of sodium are under-recognized. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Excessive sodium intake is a risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular death. Processed foods provide the highest sodium content in the diet and the amount is shown on the package labels. The aim of this study was to know if consumers read and understand the information related to sodium listed on the labels, are aware about the relation between sodium and salt, know the maximum amount of salt recommended for daily consumption and if they receive medical advice about the importance of dietary sodium intake. Material and method: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed. The information was collected through a survey given to adults older than 19 years old in the waiting room consultations of internal medicine and pediatrics at Clínica Las Condes during 2012. Results: 308 (89,2%) of a total of 345 surveys were answered completely. 93,8% of women and 80,0% of men (p<0,001) care about healthy eating, 70,4% reported knowing the difference between sodium and salt. 39,8% referred to read always the labels, 52,2% only sometimes and 8% never. The highest degree of knowledge referred by respondents were those who reported reading labels, with a significant difference to those who reported not reading labels. (p=0,001). 30,5% of women and 28,6% of men were aware about the recommended dietary salt intake. 53,3% reported not receiving professional advice about the relevance of sodium in the diet. Conclusion: Most of the respondents expressed their interest in healthy eating. However, only a minority referred to read the labels, to know the daily recommended dietary salt intake and to receive information about the importance of sodium in the diet. © 2015},

abstract={The availability of food quickly prepared at lower cost and with consistent quality and convenience has made a variety of restaurant chains extremely popular. Commonly referred to as the fast food industry, these companies have stores on virtually every street corner in cities large and small. Fast foods contribute to energy intake, and depending on the food choices made, provide foods and nutrients that should be decreased in the diet. As Americans have become more conscious of their risk factors for heart disease and recognized eating patterns as a contributor to blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes, the fast food industry has attempted to adjust their menus to provide more healthful choices.

abstract={Characteristics of the Western diet that fueled the obesity epidemic may also impact kidney disease incidence and progression. Enlarging portion sizes over the past half century has been accompanied by increased intake of protein, sodium, and processed foods while consumption of fruits and vegetables has declined. Overall dietary patterns play a strong role for chronic disease risk including chronic kidney disease. While dietary patterns high in fresh fruits and vegetables and low in red meats, such as the Mediterranean diet, decrease the risk of chronic diseases, the Western diet, characterized by high intake of red meat, animal fat, sweets, and desserts and low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products, increases risk of chronic diseases. In this article, we review the potential mechanisms whereby several key characteristics of the typical Western diet may impact kidney disease incidence and progression. We also discuss a public health policy initiative to improve dietary choices. Reducing protein intake to the recommended daily allowance of 0.8 g/kg/day and increasing intake of fruit and vegetables and fiber may mitigate kidney disease progression and reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Background: Excess sodium intake can lead to hypertension, the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the sodium and potassium contents of foodstuff used by infants and children of Pakistan.
Methods: We analyzed the sodium and potassium contents of infant milk formula (<6 months), follow up milk formula (>6 months), baby food (cereals), biscuits, fruit juices, potato chips (crisps), cheese puffs, roasted cereals (salty), ice cream cones (kulfi) all of which are the processed food extensively used by the children. The amount of sodium and potassium contents in drinking water of few cities of Pakistan were also considered to assess the additional sodium/ potassium in the preparation of milk using infant milk formula.
Results: Na to K ratio (Na:K) was determined 0.3-1.23, 0.3-1.16, 0.33-0.82, 0.54-2.68, 0.51-0.85, 2.86 and 1.02 for infant milk formula (<6 months), follow up milk formula (>6 months), baby food (cereals), biscuits, fruit juices, potato chips (crisps, cheese puffs, roasted cereals), ice cream cones (kulfi), respectively.
Conclusion: The higher sodium content is present than most of the quoted values; whereas lower potassium is present than the recommended values. The higher Na:K ratio indicates the severity of the situation where it is commonly stated that “higher an individual‟s salt intake, the higher an individual‟s blood pressure”. Present study indicates that nearly all Pakistani children consume substantially more salt than they need which will affect health status in later life. © 2014, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

abstract={Background: High processed red meat consumption is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The high sodium content of processed red meat could increase blood pressure and explain the association with cardiovascular disease. Objective: We evaluated the relation between the consumption of unprocessed and processed red meat and incident hypertension. Design: In a prospective cohort of 44,616 disease-free French women who responded to a validated dietary questionnaire, we observed 10,256 incident cases of hypertension between 1993 and 2008. Cases were identified through self-reports of diagnosed or treated hypertension. Multivariate Cox regression models were adjusted for age, education, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, menopause, menopausal hormone therapy, and alcohol, bread, coffee, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Results: Women who consumed ≥5 servings of processed red meat/wk (50 g = 1 serving) had a 17% higher rate of hypertension than that of women who consumed <1 serving/wk (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.26; P-trend = 0.0002). No association was observed between unprocessed red meat consumption and hypertension. When women who consumed ≥5 servings of unprocessed red meat/wk (100 g = 1 serving) were compared with women who consumed <1 serving unprocessed red meat/wk, the multivariate HR was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.08; P-trend = 0.63). Conclusions: In this large prospective cohort of French women, we observed an association between the consumption of processed red meat and hypertension. We observed no association for unprocessed red meat consumption and hypertension. © 2014 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Sodium chloride commonly called table salt or salt is a viral part of human life and human evolution. Salt enhances the flavor of foods and plays a preservative as well as functional role in food processing. Apart from its use in the food industry, salt has uses in the agricultural and chemical industries as well as in water conditioning and transportation. The antimicrobial activity of salt can be both direct and indirect depending on the amount added and the purpose it serves. Since the amount of sodium chloride needed to be added to foods to prevent microbial growth is large and will cause an unacceptable taste, it usually is added in combination with other hurdles. The mechanism of inhibition of microorganisms by sodium chloride is mainly by lowering the water activity (aw) of the substrate. Studies also have indicated that sodium chloride could also have a role in interfering with substrate utilization in microorganisms. The influence of sodium chloride alone as well as its interactive effects with other factors on various microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, spore-formers, and so on in laboratory media as well as in foods have been studied in detail. Tolerance to sodium chloride has been observed in spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms and mechanisms of such tolerance have been described, and in some cases, attributed to synthesis of stress proteins and protective polyhydric alcohols. In some pathogens, such as E. coli O157:H7, salt tolerance is regulated by the rpoS sigma factor. Heat resistance of some microorganisms increases when sodium chloride is used to decrease aw. Salt-induced microbial selection is useful in fermentations. Vegetables, dairy products, meats, and seafood are preserved using salt. Salt is also useful in inhibiting some undesirable enzymes and stabilizing some desirable enzymes used in the food industry. Excessive sodium intake in humans has been linked to hypertension and the related cardiovascular problems and stroke. Hence, there are many consumer concerns and the food industry is trying to minimize the salt content of food products. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Excessive salt intake has been associated with hypertension and increased cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Reducing salt intake is considered an important public health strategy in the Netherlands. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the health benefits of salt-reduction strategies related to processed foods for the Dutch population. Design: Three salt-reduction scenarios were developed: 1) substitution of high-salt foods with low-salt foods, 2) a reduction in the sodium content of processed foods, and 3) adherence to the recommended maximum salt intake of 6 g/d. Health outcomes were obtained in 2 steps: after salt intake was modeled into blood pressure levels, the Chronic Disease Model was used to translate modeled blood pressures into incidences of cardiovascular diseases, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and life expectancies. Health outcomes of the scenarios were compared with health outcomes obtained with current salt intake. Results: In total, 4.8% of acute myocardial infarction cases, 1.7% of congestive heart failure cases, and 5.8% of stroke cases might be prevented if salt intake meets the recommended maximum intake. The burden of disease might be reduced by 56,400 DALYs, and life expectancy might increase by 0.15 y for a 40-y-old individual. Substitution of foods with comparable low-salt alternatives would lead to slightly higher salt intake reductions and thus to more health gain. The estimates for sodium reduction in processed foods would be slightly lower. Conclusion: Substantial health benefits might be achieved when added salt is removed from processed foods and when consumers choose more low-salt food alternatives. © 2014 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Background: Recent studies have shown inconsistent effects of sodium reduction, potassium intake, and the ratio of sodium to potassium (Na/K ratio) on hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Major gaps exist in knowledge regarding these issues in China. Objective: We analyzed the patterns and trends of dietary sodium intake, potassium intake, and the Na/K ratio and their relations with incident hypertension in China. Design: The China Health and Nutrition Survey cohort includes 16,869 adults aged 20-60 y from 1991 to 2009. Three consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and condiment and food weights provided detailed dietary data.Multinomial logistic regression models determined trends and patterns of sodium and potassium intake and the Na/K ratio. Models for survival-time data estimated the hazard of incident hypertension. Results: Sodium intake is decreasing but remains double the Institute of Medicine recommendations. Most sodium comes from added condiments. Adults in the central provinces have the highest sodium intake and the most rapid increase in hypertension. Potassium intake has increased slightly but is below half of the recommended amount. The Na/K ratio is significantly higher than the recommended amounts. Recent measurements of high sodium intake, low potassium intake, and high Na/K ratio have strong independent dose-response associations with incident hypertension. Conclusions: Reducing sodium in processed foods, the major public health strategy in Western countries, may be less effective in China, where salt intake remains high. Replacing sodium with potassium in salt to control and prevent hypertension in China should be considered along with other public health and clinical prevention options. © 2014 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature mortality in the developed world, and hypertension is its most important risk factor. Controlling hypertension is a major focus of public health initiatives, and dietary approaches have historically focused on sodium. While the potential benefits of sodium-reduction strategies are debatable, one fact about which there is little debate is that the predominant sources of sodium in the diet are industrially processed foods. Processed foods also happen to be generally high in added sugars, the consumption of which might be more strongly and directly associated with hypertension and cardiometabolic risk. Evidence from epidemiological studies and experimental trials in animals and humans suggests that added sugars, particularly fructose, may increase blood pressure and blood pressure variability, increase heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, and contribute to inflammation, insulin resistance and broader metabolic dysfunction. Thus, while there is no argument that recommendations to reduce consumption of processed foods are highly appropriate and advisable, the arguments in this review are that the benefits of such recommendations might have less to do with sodium - minimally related to blood pressure and perhaps even inversely related to cardiovascular risk - and more to do with highly-refined carbohydrates. It is time for guideline committees to shift focus away from salt and focus greater attention to the likely more-consequential food additive: sugar. A reduction in the intake of added sugars, particularly fructose, and specifically in the quantities and context of industrially-manufactured consumables, would help not only curb hypertension rates, but might also help address broader problems related to cardiometabolic disease. © 2014, BMJ Publishing Group.

abstract={Objectives Dietary salt intake has been causally linked to high blood pressure and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular disease causes approximately 35% of total UK deaths, at an estimated annual cost of £30 billion. The World Health Organization and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have recommended a reduction in the intake of salt in people's diets. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of four population health policies to reduce dietary salt intake on an English population to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods The validated IMPACT CHD model was used to quantify and compare four policies: 1) Change4Life health promotion campaign, 2) front-of-pack traffic light labeling to display salt content, 3) Food Standards Agency working with the food industry to reduce salt (voluntary), and 4) mandatory reformulation to reduce salt in processed foods. The effectiveness of these policies in reducing salt intake, and hence blood pressure, was determined by systematic literature review. The model calculated the reduction in mortality associated with each policy, quantified as life-years gained over 10 years. Policy costs were calculated using evidence from published sources. Health care costs for specific CHD patient groups were estimated. Costs were compared against a "do nothing" baseline. Results All policies resulted in a life-year gain over the baseline. Change4life and labeling each gained approximately 1960 life-years, voluntary reformulation 14,560 life-years, and mandatory reformulation 19,320 life-years. Each policy appeared cost saving, with mandatory reformulation offering the largest cost saving, more than £660 million. Conclusions All policies to reduce dietary salt intake could gain life-years and reduce health care expenditure on coronary heart disease. © 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).},

abstract={Refeeding syndrome describes the metabolic and clinical changes attributed to aggressive rehabilitation of malnourished subjects. The metabolic changes of refeeding are related to hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, sodium retention and hyperglycemia, and these are believed to be mainly the result of increased insulin secretion following high carbohydrate intake. In the past few decades, increased consumption of processed food (refined cereals, oils, sugar and sweeteners, and so on) lowered the intake of several macrominerals (mainly phosphorus, potassium and magnesium). This seems to have compromised the postprandial status of these macrominerals, in a manner that mimics low grade refeeding syndrome status. At the pathophysiological level, this condition favored the development of the different components of the metabolic syndrome. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that metabolic syndrome is the result of long term exposure to a mild refeeding syndrome. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={The scientific underpinning for recommended levels of dietary sodium and potassium intake is of great importance to healthcare providers and policy decisionmakers. Recent clinical trials and meta-analyses confirm the capacity of dietary sodium reduction and potassium supplementation to reduce blood pressure with no harmful effects on blood lipid levels in customary clinical settings. Blood pressure is thought to be a good surrogate for cardiovascular disease events and the most important preventable risk factor for mortality and disability-adjusted life years. Cohort analyses and related pooling studies that have been used to explore the relationship between dietary Na and CVD were all based on secondary analyses of datasets that were not designed for this purpose. Most are of insufficient quality to provide dependable information. The limited information available from clinical trial experience and cohort studies of higher quality suggests a reduction in dietary Na decreases CVD morbidity and mortality. Modeling studies suggest that a small reduction in dietary sodium would result in a sizable general population health benefit. Some countries have experienced a progressive decline in average dietary sodium consumption. However, there is no evidence of a corresponding trend in the United States, and almost the entire population is failing to meet dietary sodium and potassium guideline recommendations. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.},

abstract={The United Kingdom has successfully implemented a salt reduction programme. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the programme with an aim of providing a step-by-step guide of developing and implementing a national salt reduction strategy, which other countries could follow. The key components include (1) setting up an action group with strong leadership and scientific credibility; (2) determining salt intake by measuring 24-h urinary sodium, identifying the sources of salt by dietary record; (3) setting a target for population salt intake and developing a salt reduction strategy; (4) setting progressively lower salt targets for different categories of food, with a clear time frame for the industry to achieve; (5) working with the industry to reformulate food with less salt; (6) engaging and recruiting of ministerial support and potential threat of regulation by the Department of Health (DH); (7) clear nutritional labelling; (8) consumer awareness campaign; and (9) monitoring progress by (a) frequent surveys and media publicity of salt content in food, including naming and shaming, (b) repeated 24-h urinary sodium at 3-5 year intervals. Since the salt reduction programme started in 2003/2004, significant progress has been made as demonstrated by the reductions in salt content in many processed food and a 15% reduction in 24-h urinary sodium over 7 years (from 9.5 to 8.1 g per day, P<0.05). The UK salt reduction programme reduced the population's salt intake by gradual reformulation on a voluntary basis. Several countries are following the United Kingdom's lead. The challenge now is to engage other countries with appropriate local modifications. A reduction in salt intake worldwide will result in major public health improvements and cost savings. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background Current recommendations target sodium reduction in the food supply and intake; however, information is limited on consumer readiness for these actions. Purpose Prevalence and determinants of consumer agreement for government restriction of manufacturers and restaurants putting excess salt in food and support for policies limiting sodium content of quick service restaurant (QSR) foods were examined. Methods Data were analyzed from 9,579 adults aged ≥18 years who responded to consumer readiness for sodium reduction questions in the 2010 ConsumerStyles survey. Responses were collapsed into three categories. Consumer agreement was determined and logistic regression was used to estimate ORs. Analyses were conducted in 2012. Results The majority of consumers agree that it is a good idea for government to restrict food manufacturers (55.9%) from putting excess salt in foods. About half agreed that it is a good idea for government to restrict restaurants from putting excess salt in foods and 81.5% supported sodium reduction policies in QSRs. Odds of agreement/support were higher for non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites, and those with incomes <$40,000 compared with ≥$60,000. Those reporting "neutral" or "yes" to wanting to eat a diet low in sodium were more likely to agree/support government action compared to those answering "no." Conclusions Nearly half of consumers agree with government actions to reduce sodium in manufactured and restaurant foods, with even greater support for QSRs. These findings could inform industry and public health partners about consumer preferences to lower the sodium content of the food supply. © 2014 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract={This comprehensive review summarizes the effects of migration and immigration on the development of hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors the world over-Europe, Asia, Africa, North, South and Central America, China, Australia, and the Middle East. The process of acculturation that populations undergo as they move from small, rural, agricultural economies to industrialized towns and cities takes a toll on health and well-being. Surroundings change, a new culture has to be adapted to, a new language learned, lifestyles changed, physical activity often drastically reduced, and major changes made in eating habits as low-sodium low-fat diets are replaced by processed foods and high amounts of salt. Even populations that move from one westernized country to another undergo these traumas. The results: increased stress, hypertension, obesity and diabetes. These changes are more severe in the elderly than young people, who adapt to their new home more quickly. While such reactions to migration are seen worldwide, all populations do not respond the same, the result of constitutional differences and of the different cultures from whence they came. These dramatic changes put the onus on the governments and health services of the host countries to tailor prevention and treatment programs to these different populations-proactive programs that are sorely lacking in most countries. The literature documents these phenomena, and can serve as a wake-up call to what is becoming a major worldwide health issue as populations shift and peoples struggle to adapt. © 2014 American Society of Hypertension.

abstract={Summary: China's food consumption patterns and eating and cooking behaviours changed dramatically between 1991 and 2011. Macronutrient composition has shifted towards fats, and protein and sodium intakes remain high and potassium intake low. The rapid decline in intake of coarse grains and, later, of refined grains and increases in intake of edible oils and animal-source foods accompanied by major eating and cooking behaviour shifts are leading to what might be characterized as an unhealthy Western type of diet, often based on traditional recipes with major additions and changes. The most popular animal-source food is pork, and consumption of poultry and eggs is increasing. The changes in cooking and eating styles include a decrease in the proportion of food steamed, baked, or boiled, and an increase in snacking and eating away from home. Prior to the last decade, there was essentially no snacking in China except for hot water or green tea. Most recently, the intake of foods high in added sugar has increased. The dietary shifts are affected greatly by the country's urbanization. The future, as exemplified by the diet of the three mega cities, promises major growth in consumption of processed foods and beverages. © 2014 The Authors.

A cross-sectional survey was carried out among subjects aged18 years and above at Rangpur division, of Bangladesh from 1st July, 2012 to 30th April, 2013. After written informed consent and approval from ethic committee, subjects were selected (total n=481, 52.8% female, males 47.2%) randomly based on voters list. The sampling frame consisted of the total final population of the Rangpur city according to the 2011 census of Bangladesh. Evaluation was by a physician and a dietitian administered questionnaire, a physical examination and using a sphygmomanometer. The diagnosis of prehypertension and hypertension were based on modified JNC-VII criteria. Results. The prevalence of hypertension and prehypertension in the study population were 33.3% and 29.9% respectively without any gender difference. Prevalence of hypertension in 18-29 year age group was 9.35% and &gt;70 years age group 53.84% (P value 0.00016134). Majority of the study subjects were illiterate (48.6%). Risk factors of hypertension and prehypertension were; age, obesity, added salt, diabetes mellitus, physical inactivity, prolonged use of contraceptive. Only 25.2% of the study populations had knowledge (high blood pressure is hypertension) of hypertension. Among the previously diagnosed hypertensive patients, 46.67% (n=28) took the antihypertensive drugs regularly and blood pressure was at controlled level (&lt;140/90 mm of Hg) in 36.06%. Only 61.66% patients were coming for regular follow up and ignorance and poverty were the main causes of irregular follow up. Conclusions. Prevalence of hypertension and its risk factors in Rangpur division of Bangladesh is high. Co-ordinated approach from local and Government level may be needed to combat this situation. © Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Aim: Reducing dietary sodium and increasing dietary potassium are recommended to reduce blood pressure. This study aimed to determine the main foods sources of sodium and potassium. Methods: Participants were recruited via advertisements or blood pressure screening sessions. Food sources of sodium and potassium were assessed via 24-hour dietary records in 299 free-living Australian adults (141 male, 158 female; age 54.6(9.5)years; BMI 29.4(3.9)kg/m2). Results: The mean sodium intake was 118(51)mmol/d (2725(1176)mg/d) and the mean potassium intake was 91(28)mmol/d (3550(1098)mg/d). Breads and cereals provided the majority (38%) of sodium with bread contributing 20%. Vegetable products/dishes contributed most potassium (23%) with potatoes providing 9%. Main meals provided 89% of sodium and 85% of potassium. Lunch and dinner provided similar sodium proportions (34% and 38%, respectively) but more energy was consumed at dinner (26% vs 40%, respectively). Lunch had the highest sodium density of all meals (420mg/MJ). Conclusion: A reduction in the salt content of processed foods, particularly bread, is recommended to decrease sodium intake. This reduction in salt content combined with meal specific education focusing on choosing lower sodium foods at lunch in particular, as well as incorporating more fruits and vegetables, could effectively reduce dietary sodium and increase potassium. © 2013 Dietitians Association of Australia.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Trial provides critical data on the impact of a specific diet pattern (low in salt, fat, and processed foods and high in fruit and vegetables) on blood pressure (BP). The effect of compliance with a DASH-type diet on BP in a general population sample is less well defined. We studied associations between a DASH style diet and BP.
METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from a study of men and women aged 47-73 years (n = 2,047). Participants completed a physical examination that included 3 standardized clinical BP recordings. A subsample (n = 1,187) had ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM) taken. Diet was assessed using a DASH dietary score constructed from a standard Food Frequency Questionnaire. Lower scores indicated less healthy diets. Hypertension was defined as clinic BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg on medication or as 24-hour ABPM ≥ 130/80 mmHg.
RESULTS: Inverse associations were evident between DASH and systolic BP (SBP). There was a difference in clinic SBP of 7.5 mm Hg and 5.1 mm Hg and a difference in ABPM SBP of 6.3mm Hg and 5.4mm Hg in men and women, respectively, between the highest and lowest DASH quintiles. In fully adjusted multivariable regression analysis, DASH score was inversely associated with SBP. Clear population differences in SBP were evident across DASH quintiles.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations indicate that the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adherence to DASH-equivalent diet can reduce BP at the population level. Public policy promoting a DASH-style healthy diet could have a significant impact on population health by reducing average BP in the population. © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2013.

abstract={The aims of this review paper are to provide an overview of the association of sodium intake with cardiovascular health, to identify sodium in our global food supply and to describe problems associated with assessment of dietary sodium intake. Excess sodium intake may contribute to the development of hypertension in some individuals, consequently increasing CVD risk. The average intake of sodium in populations around the world far exceeds the actual body's needs. Processed and restaurant foods contribute the most dietary sodium for Americans and other populations worldwide. There is a worldwide focus on reducing sodium content of food products in an effort to reduce health related issues associated with excessive salt and sodium intake in individuals. In several countries, regulations have been introduced to lower the sodium content of foods. Manufacturers are complying with these regulations by formulating new products to meet these standards. However, the variability in food sodium content poses challenges to researchers to accurately assess dietary sodium intakes of individuals. There are differences in sodium content of foods in databases compared with nutritional information provided by manufacturers for the same food products. Variations also exist in restaurant foods, where values differ from those available on restaurant websites. Sodium may be either underestimated or overestimated; it is not always on target. Awareness of the variability among food products is crucial but capturing sodium content of every food in the market is not feasible. Whenever possible, updating databases is critical. In conclusion, it is not feasible to capture the sodium content of every food in the marketplace but being aware of these differences is essential to assessing actual sodium consumption. Since biological determinations are burdensome and impractical, it is imperative for researchers and other health professionals to participate in the development and implementation of tools to accurately assess sodium intake in individuals.

abstract={Introduction: The current salt intake is very high for children as well as adults in China. A reduction in salt intake is one of the most cost-effective measures to curb the rapidly growing disease burden attributed to blood pressure and cardiovascular disease in the Chinese population. A lower salt diet starting from childhood has the potential to prevent the development of such conditions. The School-EduSalt (School-based Education Programme to Reduce Salt) study aims to determine whether an education programme targeted at school children can lower salt intake in children and their families. Methods and analysis: The study is designed as a cluster randomised controlled trial. The location is Changzhi, Shanxi province in northern China. The study population will consist of 28 primary schools with 280 children aged ≈11 years and 560 adult family members. Children in the intervention group will be educated on how to reduce salt intake. They will then be empowered to deliver the salt reduction message home to their families. In particular, children need to persuade the person who does the cooking to reduce the amount of salt used during food preparations. The duration of the intervention is one school term (≈4.5 months). The primary outcome is the difference between the intervention and the control group in the change in 24 h urinary sodium and the secondary outcome is the difference between the intervention and control group in the change of blood pressure. An economic evaluation will be undertaken to assess costeffectiveness. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been approved by The Queen Mary Research Ethics Committee (QMREC2012/81) and Peking University Health Science Centre IRB (IRB00001052-12072). Study findings will be disseminated widely through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.

abstract={IMPORTANCE: Excess consumption of sodium is an important cause of hypertension, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The higher the level of consumption, the greater is a person's likelihood of developing hypertension. Numerous organizations have recommended reductions in sodium intake in the United States. Roughly 80% of the sodium consumed by Americans has been added by food manufacturers and restaurants. OBJECTIVE: To compare the mean (SD) levels of sodium for identical products ascertained in 2005, 2008, and 2011. DESIGN AND SETTING Comparison study in an academic research setting. PARTICIPANTS AND EXPOSURES: Center for Science in the Public Interest staff have monitored sodium levels in selected processed foods and fast-food restaurant foods for many years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sodium content in identical foods, as measured in 2005, 2008, and 2011. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2011, the sodium content in 402 processed foods declined by approximately 3.5%, while the sodium content in 78 fast-food restaurant products increased by 2.6%. Although some products showed decreases of at least 30%, a greater number of products showed increases of at least 30%. The predominant finding is the absence of any appreciable or statistically significant changes in sodium content during 6 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on our sample, reductions in sodium levels in processed and restaurant foods are inconsistent and slow. These findings are in accord with other data indicating the slow pace of voluntary reductions in sodium levels in processed and restaurant foods. Stronger action (eg, phased-in limits on sodium levels set by the federal government) is needed to lower sodium levels and reduce the prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract={Dietary guidelines emphasize selecting lean (low-fat) meats to reduce saturated fat and cholesterol, but growing evidence suggests that health effects may relate to other ingredients, such as sodium, heme iron, or L-carnitine. Understanding how meats influence health, and on which nutrients this relationship depends, is essential to advise consumer choices, set guidelines, and inform food reformulations. A recent study published in BMC Medicine involving 448,568 participants in 10 European countries, provides important evidence in this regard. After multivariate adjustment, intake of unprocessed red meat was not significantly associated with total or cause-specific mortality; conversely, intake of processed meat was associated with a 30% higher rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (per 50 g/day, relative risk 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.45) and also higher cancer mortality. These findings are consistent with our previous meta-analysis, based on smaller studies, showing strong associations of processed meats, but not unprocessed meats, with CVD. Preservatives are the notable difference; the calculated blood-pressure effects of sodium differences (around 400% higher in processed meats) explain most of the observed higher risk. Although unprocessed red meats seem to be relatively neutral for CVD, healthier choices are available, including fish, nuts, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Public-health guidance should prioritize avoidance of processed meats, including the low-fat deli meats currently marketed as healthy choices, and the food industry should substantially reduce sodium and other preservatives in processed meats.

abstract={Population-wide dietary sodium reduction is considered a priority intervention to address sodium-related chronic diseases. In 2010, the Canadian government adopted a sodium reduction strategy to lower sodium intakes of Canadians; however, there has been a lack of coordinated action in its implementation. Our objective was to evaluate Canadians' concern, actions, reported barriers, and support for government-led policy interventions aimed at lowering sodium intakes. We conducted a survey among Canadians about sodium knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours. Data were weighted to reflect the 2006 Canadian census. Among 2603 respondents, 67.0% were concerned about dietary sodium and 59.3% were currently taking action to limit sodium intake. Those aged 50-59 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.72) and 60-69 years (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.05-2.55) were more likely to be concerned about sodium vs younger individuals (20-29 years), as were hypertensive patients vs normotensive patients (OR, 4.13; 95% CI, 3.05-5.59). Older age groups and those with hypertension (OR, 3.48; 95% CI, 2.58-4.69) were also more likely to limit sodium consumption. Common barriers to sodium reduction were limited variety of lower sodium processed (55.5%) and restaurant (65.8%) foods. High support for government-led actions was observed, including interventions for lowering sodium levels in processed (86.6%) and restaurant (72.7%-74.3%) foods, and in food served in public institutions (81.8%-82.3%), and also for public education (80.4%-83.1%). There was much less support for financial incentives and disincentives. In conclusion, these concerns, barriers, and high level of support for government action provide further rationale for multi-sectoral interventions to assist Canadians in lowering their sodium intakes. © 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.},

abstract={In South Africa, rapid urbanisation and epidemiological transition have left the black urban population vulnerable to diseases of lifestyle such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and heart disease, as well as chronic heart failure. This is in part due to the fact that changes in dietary patterns during urbanisation play an important role in the increase of risk factors of these diseases. The South African population is made up of many different ethnic and cultural groups, each with its own way of eating and food choices. The black African population is one such an ethnic group, with its own distinct eating patterns and food choices. The diets of people living in rural areas tend to still be higher in carbohydrates, lower in fat, lower in sugar and higher in fibre, corresponding to the more traditional way of eating. With urbanisation their diet has changed to a more westernised diet with the resultant decrease in carbohydrates and fibre and an increased fat, processed food and salt consumption. Factors that might contribute to this change in dietary patterns include lack of awareness and knowledge around nutritional recommendations for persons suffering from chronic heart failure, urbanisation, socio-economic circumstances, food insecurity and level of education. Nutritional recommendations and intervention programs for the prevention and management of CHF focusing on food that is culturally sensitive and affordable should be implemented. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Objective: Universal salt iodization is an effective strategy to optimize population-level iodine. At the same time as salt-lowering initiatives are encouraged globally, there is concern about compromised iodine intakes. This study investigated whether salt intakes at recommended levels resulted in a suboptimal iodine status in a country where salt is the vehicle for iodine fortification. Methods: Three 24-h urine samples were collected for the assessment of urinary sodium and one sample was taken for urinary iodine concentrations (UICs) in a convenience sample of 262 adult men and women in Cape Town, South Africa. Median UIC was compared across categories of sodium excretion equivalent to salt intakes lower than 5, 5 to 9, and greater than or equal to 9 g/d. Results: The median UIC was 120 μg/L (interquartile range 75.3-196.3), indicating iodine sufficiency. Less one-fourth (23.2%) of subjects had urinary sodium excretion values within the desirable range (salt <5 g/d), 50.7% had high values (5-9 g/d), and 22.8% had very high values (≥9 g/d). No association between urinary iodine and mean 3 × 24-h urinary sodium concentration was found (r = 0.087, P = 0.198) and UIC status did not differ according to urinary sodium categories (P = 0.804). Conclusion: In a country with mandatory universal salt iodization, consumers with salt intakes within the recommended range (<5 g/d) are iodine replete, and median UIC does not differ across categories of salt intake. This indicates that much of the dietary salt is provided from non-iodinated sources, presumably added to processed foods. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Sodium- and phosphorus-based food additives are among the most commonly consumed nutrients in the world. This is because both have diverse applications in processed food manufacturing, leading to their widespread use by the food industry. Since most foods are naturally low in salt, sodium additives almost completely account for the excessive consumption of sodium throughout the world. Similarly, phosphorus additives represent a major and "hidden" phosphorus load in modern diets. These factors pose a major barrier to successfully lowering sodium or phosphorus intake in patients with CKD. As such, any serious effort to reduce sodium or phosphorus consumption will require reductions in the use of these additives by the food industry. The current regulatory environment governing the use of food additives does not favor this goal, however, in large part because these additives have historically been classified as generally safe for public consumption. To overcome these barriers, coordinated efforts will be needed to demonstrate that high intake of these additives is not safe for public consumption and as such should be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. © 2013 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Objective To measure adherence and to identify factors associated with adherence to antihypertensive medications in family practice patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension. Design A cross-sectional study using a mailed patient self-report survey and clinical data. Setting Twenty-seven family physician and nurse practitioner clinics from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island (the Maritime Family Practice Research Network). Participants A total of 527 patients with type 2 DM and hypertension who had had their blood pressure measured with the BpTRU (an automated oscillometric instrument) at family practice clinic visits within the previous 6 months. Main outcome measures Level of adherence to antihypertension medications as measured by patients' self-report on the Morisky scale; association between high adherence on the Morisky scale and 22 patient factors related to demographic characteristics, clinical variables, knowledge, beliefs, behaviour, health care provider relationships, and health system influences. Results The survey response rate was 89.6%. The average age of patients was 66 years, and 51.6% of participants were men. Forty-three percent of patients had had a diagnosis of DM for more than 10 years, and 49.7% had had a diagnosis of hypertension for more than 10 years. Eighty-nine percent of patients had some form of medical insurance. All patients had seen their family physician providers at least once within the past year. Seventy-seven percent of patients reported high adherence as measured by the Morisky scale. On multiple logistic regression, being older than 55, taking more than 7 prescribed medications, and having a lifestyle that included regular exercise or a healthy diet with low salt intake or both were significant independent predictors of high adherence scores on the Morisky scale (P > .05). Conclusion More than three-quarters of patients with type 2 DM and hypertension from community family practice clinics in Maritime Canada reported high adherence to their antihypertensive medications. Family physicians and nurse practitioners can apply strategies to improve antihypertensive medication adherence among type 2 DM patients who are younger, taking fewer medications, or not maintaining a lifestyle that includes regular exercise or a healthy diet or both. Future studies will need to determine whether focusing adherence strategies on these patients will improve their cardiovascular outcomes.},

abstract={The role of the food industry (retailers, manufacturers and food service) in helping consumers eat healthily and sustainably has been receiving considerable attention in recent years. This paper focuses on the challenges facing the food industry and the role of food reformulation in meeting these challenges, through the lens of a public health nutritionist. Attention has been heightened by the Government's Responsibility Deal, launched in early 2011 by the Department of Health (England), by the UK's engagement with the global food security and food supply sustainability agendas and by the Government Office of Science's Foresight report. The Responsibility Deal's food network has to date focused on reduction of trans fatty acids, salt and calories and out-of-home calorie labelling (in food service settings). New pledges are expected soon on increasing fruit and vegetable intakes. Reformulation is a major feature of the Responsibility Deal's approach, and along with other approaches such as portion control, choice editing and information provision, there is potential to increase the breadth of healthier choices available to the public. With the exception of fruit and vegetables, the emphasis has been almost exclusively on aspects of the diet that are in excess for many of the population (e.g. energy and salt). Evidence of low consumption of some key micronutrients by some groups of the population, particularly adolescents and young adults, often alongside excess energy intake compared with expenditure, is all too often overlooked. This paper summarises the progress made to date, the challenges faced and the opportunities that exist, with particular focus on reformulation. One of the biggest challenges is the relatively poor understanding of how to effect positive and long-term dietary behaviour change. The paper concludes that, in isolation, reformulation is unlikely to provide a complete solution to the challenge of improving eating patterns and nutrient provision, although it is a contributor.

abstract={Magnesium (Mg) is one of the most important intracellular cations in the human body. It catalyzes many reactions of carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism. Researches show that many people do not have enough products rich in magnesium in their diets. Proper/reference magnesium blood plasma level is 0.65-1.25 mmol/l. Magnesium deficiencies may cause arrhythmia as well as mood disorders, depression and difficulties in concentrating. Magnesium deficiency in the human body is often recognized in the industrialized countries and is caused mainly by the increased consumption of the processed foods. Daily magnesium intake increases in stress, intense physical activity, pregnancy and lactation. Bioavailability of magnesium supplement depends on its chemical form, the presence of inorganic anion or organic ligand, water solubility, stability of the compound, presence of vitamin B6 and potassium ions, daily dosage and administration. In this review bioavailability of organic and inorganic magnesium compounds, supplement composition and magnesium ion content is presented. Magnesium ion complexes with organic ligands are more stable in acidic environment, and give better absorption, thus higher bioavailability due to easier passage through the intestinal wall. Greater intestinal absorption of magnesium organic complexes, mainly citrates, than inorganic salts is observed. Many clinical studies point to the importance of magnesium deficiencies in the development of hypertension and stroke. Magnesium has a direct, dilating influence on vascular endothelium through the influx of calcium into cells. In many studies it has been confirmed that there exists the dependence between the magnesium supplementation and the decrease in blood pressure. Antihypertensive efficacy of magnesium is small, therefore this cation can only be an additional element of a therapy. Magnesium decreases the risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome development. Polish and European Society of Hypertension recommend the DASH diet, which contains 500 mg of Mg per 2100 kcal and which does not require additional Mg intake. Copyright © 2013 Via Medica.},

abstract={Compared with any other race/ethnic group in the United States, African - Americanshave the highest incidence of CHD and heart failure - with an earlier age of onset. Theyalso exhibit the highest overall prevalence of hypertension, LVH, stroke and heart failure;as well as the highest rate of out - of - hospital coronary death, and mortality fromhypertension, heart failure, stroke and sudden cardiac death. The high rate of CVD andCHD observed in African - Americans appears to be out of proportion to risk burden. Assuch, different mechanisms for CHD and CVD have been suggested in this group.Some observed differences in pathophysiology of CVD in African - Americanscompared with any other race/ethnicity within the US include higher salt - sensitivity, andmore microvascular disease/endothelial dysfunction as a contributor to CHD. For thosewith CAD, stabilization of coronary plaque through fibrosis and calcification appears tobe less common in this population.This could explain the higher rate of coronary - related deaths in African - Americans,despite an observed lower rate of obstructive CAD. In African - Americans, themechanism of heart failure - which is more common in this race compared with anyother race in the U.S. - appears to be more often a function of hypertension and LVH,rather than CAD as observed in non - African - Americans. These differences inpathophysiology have therapeutic implications for different aspects of CVD in African - American patients, such as heart failure and even blood pressure control.Given the higher prevalence of obesity in African - Americans, efforts aimed atweight reduction in this population, as well as obesity prevention in African - Americanchildren - through education on diet and exercise - could translate into immense riskfactor modification, and reduced overall CVD incidence and prevalence in African- Americans. Some genetic polymorphisms have been linked to mechanisms of differentaspects of CVD in African - Americans and are discussed here, along with the role ofproteomics, ribomics, metabolomics, lipomics and pharmacogenomics in futureprevention of CVD. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In addition to annually published indicators of health, this year's report contains a highlighted new section on noncommunicable diseases and their impact on world health. The section gives particular attention to hypertension and obesity. Interestingly, despite worldwide increases in obesity and metabolic syndrome, hypertension rates have actually improved in wealthy nations since 1980, while rates have greatly increased in developing regions and particularly in Africa. Potential contributors to these disparities likely include access to screening and treatment, and the rise of high sodium and low potassium processed foods in poorer nations. It will be imperative in years to come to identify and employ the success seen in wealthy nations worldwide to improve outcomes and productivity in the developing world. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

In addition to obesity, salt is associated with increased rates of cardiovascular disease (especially hypertension), gastric cancer, and osteoporosis. Most Americans consume much more salt than they need or is healthy, with up to 75% of it coming from prepared foods. To be successful, these campaigns must educate young consumers. These campaigns must also incorporate food manufacturers and change our dining environments so that low-sodium foods are accessible and affordable. © 2012 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc.

abstract={Bread is widely considered to be the foodstuff that provides the most dietary salt to the diet. As such, it is one of the key public health targets for a salt reduction policy. In this respect, it has been shown that a reduction in the salt content of bread is possible, and an alternative approach involves partial replacement with other, mainly potassium-based salts, which also counteract the effects of sodium. This replacement should be undertaken on the basis of criteria that maintain the product's sensory profile, and it tends to be more successful in breads with more naturally flavorful taste. The present review was conducted to examine salt intake in Europe and the health problems associated with its excessive consumption; particular focus is placed on the salt content of bread and the effects of its possible reduction and/or correction. The beneficial effects of such changes are highlighted by way of a theoretical calculation in baguette-type wheat bread. European legislation in the field of nutrition and health claims allows the positive aspects of such salt reduction and replacement methods to be stated. © 2012 International Life Sciences Institute.},

abstract={Cardiac function depends on multiple factors. Preload, afterload, heart rate and contractility are the most recognizable. Myocardial dysfunction is a clinical syndrome characterized by heart abnormalities. It accompanied by renal, neural and hormonal alterations. Commonly, occurs in a heart that has been previously damaged by multiple factors. The increases of arterial blood pressure and coronary heart disease are the most important risk factors.In addition of the description of hemodynamic characteristics, in this chapter we show that heart failure is not only the consequence of a hemodynamic process which involves the retention of water and salt, but a complex syndrome with significant neurohumoral alterations that contribute towards the symptoms and progression of the disease. Exist various methods for evaluate the myocardial dysfunction. Nevertheless, hemodynamic monitoring which is performed with a transthoracic echocardiogram, is the most frequently used in the present, due to the amount of morphofunctional information which this test provides, high accessibility and lower cost. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) have several potentially important effects on endothelial function and are implicated in physiological regulation and contractility alterations. Free radicals contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction by a range of mechanisms and induce both necrotic and apoptotic cell death. This is consistent with the negative relationship between higher values of lipid peroxidation biomarkers and low values of ventricular function in critically ill patients. Reversibility of myocardial dysfunction during a period from 7 to 10 days in survivors is other typical manifestation of septic myocardial dysfunction. Hence, one can speculate that development of such a type of myocardial dysfunction as a temporary protective compensatory mechanism could be advantageous for of an individual patient. A large body of evidence about mechanisms of myocardial dysfunction was described; endothelial dysfunction with consequent microcirculatory and mitochondrial dysfunction and role of circulating factors are considered to be the most important. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={This article describes the progress-as well as the challenges and limitations-in reducing salt intake in Costa Rica. The National Plan to Reduce Public Consumption of Salt/Sodium in Costa Rica 2011-2021 was complemented with multisectoral programs and projects specifically designed to: 1) determine sodium intake and the salt/sodium content of the most widely consumed foods; identify the consumer knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors with regard to salt/sodium, their relationship to health, and nutritional labeling; evaluate the cost-effectiveness of measures aimed at reducing the incidence of hypertension; 2) implement strategies to reduce the salt/sodium content of processed foods and foods prepared at home; 3) promote behavioral changes in the population to reduce salt in people's diets; and 4) monitor and evaluate action geared to reducing salt/sodium intake in the population. Meeting the proposed targets will require successful interinstitutional coordination among the strategic actors, the negotiation of commitments with the food industry and food services, and tighter regulation of critical nutrients in foods associated with chronic noncommunicable diseases. Given the progress made during the implementation of the National Plan, Costa Rica is expected to meet the international goal of reducing salt intake. © 2013 Organización Panamericana de la Salud.},

abstract={There is compelling evidence that dietary salt intake is the major cause of raised blood pressure (BP) and that a reduction in salt intake from the current level of ̃ 9-12 g/day in most countries to the recommended level of < 5 g/day lowers BP. A further reduction to 3-4 g/day has a greater effect and there needs to be ongoing consideration of lower targets for population salt intake. Cohort studies and outcome trials have demonstrated that a lower salt intake is related to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Salt reduction is one of the most costeffective measures to improve public health worldwide. In the Americas, a salt intake of < 9 g/day is highly prevalent. Sources of salt in the diet vary hugely among countries; in developed countries, 75% of salt comes from processed foods, whereas in developing countries such as parts of Brazil, 70% comes from salt added during cooking or at the table. To reduce population salt intake, the food industry needs to implement a gradual and sustained reduction in the amount of salt added to foods in developed countries. In developing countries, a public health campaign plays a more important role in encouraging consumers to use less salt coupled with widespread replacement of salt with substitutes that are low in sodium and high in potassium. Numerous countries in the Americas have started salt reduction programs. The challenge now is to engage other countries. A reduction in population salt intake will result in a major improvement in public health along with major health-related cost savings. © 2013 Organización Panamericana de la Salud.},

abstract={The adequate intake of minerals is basically important for healthy nutrition. Aim and method: The Hungarian Diet and Nutritional Status Survey - joining to the European Health Interview Survey - studied the dietary habits of the Hungarian population. The present publication describes the macroelement intake. Results: The salt intake is unusually high (17.2 g in men and 12.0 g in women), the potassium intake remains well below the recommendation. These factors substantially increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases including high blood-pressure. The calcium intake stays below the recommendation except in the youngest males, the oldest men and women are at risk from this point of view. While magnesium intake suited the recommendation, the intake of phosphorus exceeded it twice. Conclusions: Focusing on marcroelements, high sodium/salt intake represents the highest public health risk. The implementation of STOP SALT! National Salt Reducing Programme, i.e. decrease the salt content of processed food and provide proper information to the population about excessive salt consumption, should result in a beneficial change of salt intake and ameliorate the public health conditions.},

abstract={Away-from-home foods are regulated with respect to the prevention of food-borne diseases and potential contaminants, but not for their contribution to dietary-related chronic diseases. Away-from-home foods have more calories, salt, sugar and fat, and include fewer fruits and vegetables than recommended by national nutrition guidelines. Thus, frequent consumption of away-from-home foods contributes to obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. In light of this, many localities are already adopting regulations or sponsoring programs to improve the quality of away-from-home foods. We review the rationale for developing nutritional performance standards for away-from-home foods in light of limited human capacity to regulate intake or physiologically compensate for a poor diet. We offer a set of model performance standards to be considered as a new area of environmental regulation. Models for voluntary implementation of consumer standards exist in the environmental domain and may be useful templates for implementation. Implementing such standards, whether voluntarily or via regulations, will require addressing a number of practical and ideological challenges. Politically, regulatory standards contradict the belief that adults should be able to navigate dietary risks in away-from-home settings unaided. © 2012 The Authors. obesity reviews © 2012 International Association for the Study of Obesity.},

abstract={Many studies suggest that high salt intakes are related to high blood pressure and consequently cardiovascular diseases. In addition salt intake was found to be related with obesity, renal stones, osteoporosis and stomach cancer. Belgium, such as other European countries, is suffering from both salt intakes that are twice as high as the recommended intakes and mild iodine deficiency. No comprehensive strategy encompassing both public health problems has been developed. While specific salt reduction targets for processed foods are still under discussion using a consensus approach with industry, an agreement was signed between the bakery sector and the Ministry of Health in April 2009, to encourage and increase the use of iodised salt in the production of bread. Based on results of recent surveys on population iodine status it is advised not to currently revise iodine concentrations in salt in bread but to advocate for a higher percentage of bakers using iodised salt and to install a good monitoring system to control the percentage of bakers effectively using adequately iodised salt. With regard to salt reduction, it is of utmost importance that all companies contribute and harmonise the salt content of their products according to the lowest possible thresholds in a first step. In order to achieve this goal, it will be necessary, in addition to the consensus approach, to come up with at least some legislative tools such as a salt tax or mandatory labelling of foods exceeding a specific sodium concentration. Once salt reduction targets have been clearly defined in Belgium over the longer term, a legal framework should be set in place where iodine concentration in salt for the production of bread and household salt is strictly regulated by law, to avoid a large variability in the iodine content of salt brands consumed. In conclusion, it is possible to tackle salt reduction and iodine deficiency at the same time on the condition that the approach is coordinated and well monitored. All the interventions and measures taken should clearly include education and communication directed towards consumers, food producers, public health professionals, pharmacists, healthcare workers, and media representatives. © 2012 vandevijvere; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Levels of cortisol obey a strict circadian rhythm where they are highest in the morning hours, declining during the day and lowest at 3-5 hours after the onset of sleep. Temporary alteration of this rhythm is observed under unusual conditions such as a person working on irregular shifts or suffering from jet lag. However complete loss of this episodic secretion is observed when problems with the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis are suspected such as those of Cushing's syndrome or Adrenal tumors producing cortisol. Chronically high levels of glucocorticoids such as cortisol are known to be associated with hypertension, immunosuppression, osteoporosis and depression. Cortisone is one of the several end products of enzyme mediated steroidogenesis that begins with cholesterol. Cortisol is converted to non active cortisone by the unidirectional action of the 11-beta hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD type 2) enzyme, which is highly expressed in the kidney, colon, salivary glands and fetal tissues. This enzyme helps in maintaining normal levels of cortisol in the body by protecting the non selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) from glucocorticoid excess. Conversely, 11β-HSD type 1 enzyme which is highly expressed in the key metabolic tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue and central nervous system, controls the oxoreductase conversion of inactive cortisone to cortisol and vice versa. Inactivation of 11-βHSD type 1 or 2 enzymes leads to elevated levels of cortisol which activates the MR promoting mineralocorticoid excess conditions thereby elevating levels of sodium and water. These conditions are exhibited as hypertension in the form of apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome (AME). Evaluation of cortisol to cortisone ratios (CCR) provides us with information about the HPA axis as well as the effective balance of the 11β-HSD type 1 and 2 enzymatic activities. Even though the major site for the oxidation of cortisol to cortisone is the kidney, CCR values obtained from serum/plasma or saliva or urine are indicative of the tissue specific availability and activity of 11β-HSD type 1 and 2 enzymes. Precise measurement of CCR aids in understanding the cortisol-cortisone shuttle in preterm infants, clinical outcomes of in vitro fertilization, chronic fatigue syndrome, depressive illnesses and men with fatty liver apart from patients with Cushing's syndrome. Reduced metabolites of cortisol and cortisone (5α and β tetrahydrocortisol, allo-tetrahydrocortisol and tetrahydrocortisone) are also used to assess diseases based on their ratios. This commentary focuses on significant predictions that have been made for physiological disorders by accurate measurement of CCRs. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Hypertension and osteoporosis frequently coexist in elderly women. Some clinical studies demonstrated that high blood pressure might be a risk factor for bone fractures, probably due to secondary activation of the parathyroid gland through increase in urinary calcium excretion. Hypertension and osteoporosis may share the same background genetically and environmentally. However, the precise underlying mechanisms have not been clearly established. An essential approach to clarify their relation is to investigate the effects and the mechanisms of anti-hypertensive drugs on bone metabolism. Of importance, several anti-hypertensive drugs, including thiazides, beta(ß)-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decreased the risk of bone fractures and increased bone mineral density (BMD) clinically. Thiazide diuretics (TD) act on the distal nephron of the kidney, blocking sodium and chloride secretion and enhancing sodium-calcium exchange, leading to high calcium concentration in blood and prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism. They may also directly act on osteoclasts, inhibiting bone resorption through carbonic anhydrase II (CAII). In addition, ß-blockers are also highlighted by the relation between sympathetic nerve system and bone metabolism, leading to increased BMD. Functional analysis of leptin in the central nerve system showed that both osteoblasts and osteoclasts possessed the adrenergic receptors, and adrenergic stimulation from sympathetic nerves enhanced bone resorption. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are divided into several subtypes, and non-dihydropyridine drugs are reported to have greater risk reduction of fractures than the dihydropyridine group, through the inhibition of hyperparathyroidism-induced calcium uptake into osteoblasts and elevation of intracellular calcium in osteoclasts. Angiotensin II is also reported to lower plasma calcium concentration and cause secondary hyperparathyroidism. We recently reported that angiotensin II increased osteoclast activation through receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) expression by osteoblasts, and enhanced bone resorption. ACE inhibitors as well as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) ameliorated osteoporosis in ovariectomised rats beyond their effect to lower blood pressure. Overall, hypertension and bone loss such as osteoporosis are closely related in several background factors, and selective treatment of hypertension would reduce the risk of bone fractures and bone loss. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Recent evidence indicates that abnormalities in calcium (Ca)-metabolism at systemic levels might play a key role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Because bone is the largest store of Ca in the body, the bone Ca-content and mineralization may represent the entire Ca-balance. The present study was performed to investigate the bone mineral density (BMD) in subjects with essential hypertension by means of the dual energy X-ray absorptiometric (DXA) method. The BMD of lumbar spine (the mean value of L2-L4) was decreased with age in both males and females. The DXA analysis showed a significant decrease in the BMD of lumbar spine (L2-L4) in female hypertensive subjects compared with female normotensive subjects. In addition, the BMD was inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure in women. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the BMD of lumbar spine (L2-L4) between male hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The twenty-four hour urinary Ca excretion (urinary Ca/Na ratio) was significantly greater in female hypertensive subjects than in female normotensive subjects. Furthermore, the greater the urinary Ca/Na ratio was, the lower the BMD in females was. The levels of serum total Ca, total Mg, ionized Ca and 1, 25 (OH)2 vitamin D were not different between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The results of the present study demonstrate that the DXA provides an index of entire Ca-balance, and suggest that high blood pressure might be associated with reduced BMD in females. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Currently, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide. High blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for the development of CVD and blood pressure levels are strongly associated with salt intake. Worldwide, salt consumptions accounts more than two fold the recommended daily intake, which has been described to be associated with CVD and some cancers. Benefits of decrease salt intake (reduction of morbidity, mortality and health related costs) have promoted several public health strategies to reduce salt consumption globally. Among the most commonly used strategies include educational campaigns and the gradual decrease of added salt in processed foods. Chile has joined these initiatives with an agreement between the producers of bread and the Ministry of Health to gradually decrease the concentration of salt in bread nationwide. The purpose of this review is to provide updated information regarding recommended intakes of salt, real intake, adverse effects of excess consumption, profits attributable to a decline and analyze the global strategies to reduce salt intake in the population.},

abstract={This article outlines the rationale for reducing dietary salt and some of the Pan American Health Organization actions to facilitate reductions in dietary salt in the Americas. Excessive dietary salt (sodium chloride and other sodium salts) is a major cause of increased blood pressure, which increases risk for stroke, heart disease, and kidney disease. Reduction in salt intake is beneficial for people with hypertension and those with normal blood pressure. The World Health Organization recommends a population salt intake of less than 5 grams/person/day with a Pan American Health Organization expert group recommendation that this be achieved by 2020 in the Americas. In general, the consumption of salt is more than 6 grams/day by age 5 years, with consumption of salt averaging between 9 and 12 grams per day in many countries. Recent salt intake estimates from Brazil (11 grams of salt/day), Argentina (12 grams of salt/day), Chile (9 grams of salt/day) and the United States (8.7 grams of salt/day) confirm that high salt intakes are prevalent in Americas. Sources of dietary salt vary, from 75% of it coming from processed food in developed countries, to 70% coming from discretionary salt added in cooking or at the table in parts of Brazil. The Pan American Health Organization has launched a regionwide initiative called the Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Through Dietary Salt Reduction, led by an expert working group. Working closely with countries, the expert group developed resources to aid policy development through five subgroups: (a) addressing industry engagement and product reformulation; (b) advocacy and communication; (c) surveillance of salt intake, sources of salt in the diet, and knowledge and opinions on salt and health; (d) salt fortification with iodine; and (e) national-level health economic studies on salt reduction.

abstract={Background: High salt intake is linked to hypertension whereas a restriction of dietary salt lowers blood pressure (BP). Substituting potassium and/or magnesium salts for sodium chloride (NaCl) may enhance the feasibility of salt restriction and lower blood pressure beyond the sodium reduction alone. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and effect on blood pressure of replacing NaCl (Regular salt) with a novel mineral salt [50% sodium chloride and rich in potassium chloride (25%), magnesium ammonium potassium chloride, hydrate (25%)] (Smart Salt). Methods. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with an intervention period of 8-weeks in subjects (n = 45) with systolic (S)BP 130-159 mmHg and/or diastolic (D)BP 85-99 mmHg. During the intervention period, subjects consumed processed foods salted with either NaCl or Smart Salt. The primary endpoint was the change in SBP. Secondary endpoints were changes in DBP, daily urine excretion of sodium (24-h dU-Na), potassium (dU-K) and magnesium (dU-Mg). Results: 24-h dU-Na decreased significantly in the Smart Salt group (-29.8 mmol; p = 0.012) and remained unchanged in the control group: resulting in a 3.3 g difference in NaCl intake between the groups. Replacement of NaCl with Smart Salt resulted in a significant reduction in SBP over 8 weeks (-7.5 mmHg; p = 0.016). SBP increased (+3.8 mmHg, p = 0.072) slightly in the Regular salt group. The difference in the change of SBP between study groups was significant (p < 0.002). Conclusions: The substitution of Smart Salt for Regular salt in subjects with high normal or mildly elevated BP resulted in a significant reduction in their daily sodium intake as well as a reduction in SBP.

abstract={Objective. To assess an intervention to reduce salt intake based on an agreement with the food industry. Methods. Salt content was measured in bakery products through a national survey and biochemical analyses. Low-salt bread was evaluated by a panel of taste testers to determine whether a reduced salt bread could remain undetected. French bread accounts for 25% of the total salt intake in Argentina; hence, reducing its salt concentration from 2% to 1.4% was proposed and tested. A crossover trial was conducted to evaluate the reduction in urinary sodium and blood pressure in participants during consumption of the low-salt bread compared with ordinary bread. Results. Average salt content in bread was 2%. This study evaluated low-salt bread containing 1.4% salt. This reduction remained mostly undetected by the panels of taste testers. In the crossover trial, which included 58 participants, a reduction of 25 milliequivalents in 24-hour urine sodium excretion, a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 1.66 mmHg, and a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 0.76 mmHg were found during the low-salt bread intake. Conclusions. The study showed that dietary salt reduction was feasible and well accepted in the population studied through a reduction of salt content in bread. Although the effects on urinary sodium and blood pressure were moderate, a countrywide intervention could have a greater public health impact. © 2011 Organización Panamericana de la Salud.},

abstract={It is well known that reduction of salt results in lowering blood pressure and cardiovascular incidents. Daily salt is double the recommended daily quantity and mainly comes from processed food. The assessment of daily salt intake for Croatia is 12 g/day (WHO recommendation is <5 g/day). The main source of sodium is processed food and food prepared in restaurants (77%), natural content of sodium in food (12%), added salt at table (6%) and prepared meals at home (5%). Reduction of salt by 50% would save nearly 180 000 lives per year in Europe. It is necessary to establish better collaboration with food manufacturers in order to reduce the content of salt in processed food and to achieve appropriate salt intake per day in accordance with the WHO recommendation. Further, it is necessary to encourage food manufacturers to produce food and meals with low or reduced salt content (shops, catering, changes in recipes, offer salt substitutions). This kind of collaboration is based on bilateral interests that can result in positive health effects. One of the most important public health tasks is to educate consumers and to give them choice when buying food. This can be achieved by effective campaigns and social marketing, by ensuring a declaration of salt content on the product, or specially designed signs for food products with low or reduced salt content.},

abstract={Numerous studies report on strong correlation between salt intake and an increased risk of some diseases. Salt intake has long been known to influence blood pressure in patients with hypertension, increased risk of renal disease, cancer and obesity. Salt is an important spice because many foods without salt have unacceptable taste. The major problem arises from the fact that most salt derives from processed foods and reduction of salt content in these sources is necessary to reduce overall salt exposure. Dietitians and/or foodservice managers have professional responsibility to produce quantity food recipes that are reduced in sodium and acceptable to customers. The daily sodium content was assessed in the menus (12 different diets) served to patients at Dubrava University Hospital in Zagreb and Dr. Josip Benčević General Hospital in Slavonski Brod. The average sodium content in the menus served at these two institutions was 1925 mg/day and 1890 mg/day, respectively. The results indicate that there is sufficient substitute for salt, it is only important to change dietary habits. In conclusion, long-term health benefits will depend on the ability of patients to make long-lasting dietary changes, along with wider availability of lower-sodium foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, which is consistent with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and to avoid foods with high salt content.},

abstract={Background Good dietary habits are important for health enhancement, while inadequate nutrition may increase susceptibility to and delay recovery from illness. To meet the needs of frail older persons and to promote functional longevity, health education on proper nutrition and exercise is important. Obesity is a relatively serious problem in Hong Kong Chinese, as elsewhere in the developed world, owing to the associated increased risks for Type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Project Aims & Preliminary Findings In this study, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among community-dwelling older persons was explored, and health-related issues regarding obesity were discussed. The study also examined the effects of a nutrition education program. A total of 61 older persons (12 males and 49 females, ages ranging from 60 to 89 years, with mean age 73 years) from two elderly community centers took part in the study. Education level, self-reported health status, body mass index, dietary habits and physical exercise pattern were recorded. Over 50% reported receiving no formal education. The majority were suffering from at least one chronic illness (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia or osteoporosis). None knew their BMI. The prevalence of overweight and obesity were very high, with 70% (n=38) overweight or obese. Consumption of "desirable" foods (fruits, vegetables, dairy and bean curd products) was low. Participants" intake of fruits and vegetables was inadequate, with 65% of the participants consuming = 1 serving of fruit/day and 33% consuming < 3 servings of vegetables/day. The majority (80%) did not consume any dairy products. Intervention: Nutrition Education Programme A nutrition and lifestyle program (NLP) was provided to these elderly in the community centers, and a learning contract approach was used to encourage older people to adhere to the programe. The NLP lasted for 8 weeks, and covered nutritional labeling, identifying healthy and unhealthy snacks and food (e.g. those high in cholesterol, saturated fat, salt), meal planning, and encouraging physical activity. Evaluation & Conclusion Participating elderly were followed up weekly regarding their learning contract on dietary modification and physical activity. Participation in the nutrition education program was high (nearly 95%); participants demonstrated increased knowledge and awareness of their health and nutritional status and were willing to follow the advice on dietary modification and lead a more active lifestyle. Nutrition behavior is a complex process; a holistic health promotion approach seems to be essential for implementing healthy nutrition behavior. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Neuroanatomical structures involved in head pain are primarily the sensory distribution of four cranial nerves: the trigeminal-and to a lesser extent, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus-as well as the terminations of the upper three cervical nerves.In addition, various pain sensitive cranial structures including the scalp and its blood supply, the head and neck muscles, intracranial and meningeal arteries, and dura mater including the venous sinuses are the major anatomical substrates of various types of headaches. Although brain tumors, different types of hemorrhage, hypertension, and meningitis may present as a headache, the migraine, cluster, and tension headaches are the three major types of primary headaches. Current opinion suggests a primary central nervous system activation may initiate a migraine. Several triggering factors such as disturbances of brain oxygenation and metabolism, alterations in the serotonin levels, low levels of brain tissue magnesium, altered transport of ions across the cell membrane, abnormal mitochondrial energy metabolism, and genetic abnormalities including mutations of the P/Q type calcium channel gene, Na+/K+ pump ATP1A2, or sodium channel Nav1.1 mutations have been linked to the pathogenesis of migraines. Patients with mutations in the calcium channel gene are more sensitive to environmental factors, which results in a wave of cortical spreading depression in the patient after the attack is initiated.Moreover, several recent clinical and diagnostic studies indicate a dysfunction of the brainstem periaqueductal gray matter during migraine, or initiation of migraine by activation of the brainstem including the dorsal rostral and midline pons. Consistent with this, an active locus in the posterior hypothalamus has been implicated in cluster headache (CH). The headache phase involves the activation of the trigeminovascular system and possibly dilatation of the cranial blood vessels presumably mediated by the release of vasoactive substances and neuropeptides including the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Increased serum CGRP levels were detected during migraine and CH. In addition, in CH, there is a release of parasympathetic peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide. Currently, inhibiting the release of vasoactive substances and neuropeptides including the CGRP or nitric oxide, or blocking their receptors in the neuroanatomical substrates of head pain is a major focus in treatment of headaches. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={The Na/K-ATPase was discovered as an energy transducing ion pump. A major difference between the Na/K-ATPase and other P-type ATPases is its ability to bind a group of chemicals called cardiotonic steroids (CTS). Endogenous CTS have been identified as a new class of endogenous hormones, functioning as important regulators of renal Na+ excretion and blood pressure. Na/K-ATPase is not only an ion pump, but also an important receptor that can transduce ligand-like effect of CTS on intracellular protein kinases. Significantly, the CTS-provoked kinase cascades are capable of inducing endocytosis of the apical NHE3 (Na/H exchanger isoform 3) and basolateral Na/K-ATPase in renal proximal tubular cells. Functionally, this CTS-induced coordinately regulation of Na/K-ATPase and NHE3 leads to the inhibition of sodium reabsorption in renal proximal tubules under physiological conditions, such as high salt diet. A defect in this regulation would reduce the ability of renal proximal tubular cells to excrete Na+, thus a contributor of salt-sensitive hypertension. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Introduction: Investigations have brought evidence that salt intake is positively related to systolic blood pressure and that children with higher blood pressure are more susceptible to hypertension in adulthood. In developed countries the main source of salt is processed food. Objective: The aim of this paper was to determine total sodium chloride (NaCl) in average daily meal (breakfast, snack and dinner) and in each of three meals children receive in kindergarten. Methods: From kindergarten, in the meal time, 88 samples of daily meals (breakfast, snacks and dinner) offered to children aged 4-6 years were taken. Standardized laboratory methods were applied to determine proteins, fats, ash and water in order to calculate energy value of meal. The titrimetric method with AgNO3, and K2CrO4 as indicator, was applied in order to determine chloride ion. Content of NaCl was calculated as %NaCl = mlAgNO3 × 0.05844 × 5 × 100/g tested portion. NaCl content in total daily meal and each meal and in 100 kcal of each meal was calculated using descriptive statistical method. Student's t-test was applied to determine statistical differences of NaCl amount among meals. Results: NaCl content in average daily meal was 5.2±1.7 g (CV 31.7%), in breakfast 1.5±0.6 g (CV 37.5%), in dinner 3.5±1.6 g (CV 46.1%) and in snack 0.3±0.4 g (CV 163.3%). NaCl content per 100 kcal of breakfast was 0.4±0.1 g (CV 29.5%), dinner 0.7±0.2 g (CV 27.8%) and snack 0.13±0.19 g (CV 145.8%). The difference of NaCl content among meals was statistically significant (p&lt;0.01).

abstract={Objective: To evaluate population health benefits and cost-effectiveness of interventions for reducing salt in the diet. Design: Proportional multistate life-table modelling of cardiovascular disease and health sector cost outcomes over the lifetime of the Australian population in 2003. Interventions The current Australian programme of incentives to the food industry for moderate reduction of salt in processed foods; a government mandate of moderate salt limits in processed foods; dietary advice for everyone at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and dietary advice for those at high risk. Main Outcome Measures: Costs measured in Australian dollars for the year 2003. Health outcomes measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted over the lifetime. Results: Mandatory and voluntary reductions in the salt content of processed food are cost-saving interventions under all modelled scenarios of discounting, costing and cardiovascular disease risk reversal (dominant cost-effectiveness ratios). Dietary advice targeting individuals is not cost-effective under any of the modelled scenarios, even if directed at those with highest blood pressure risk only (best case median cost-effectiveness A$100 000/DALY; 95% uncertainty interval A$64 000/DALY to A$180 000/DALY). Although the current programme that relies on voluntary action by the food industry is cost-effective, the population health benefits could be 20 times greater with government legislation on moderate salt limits in processed foods. Conclusions: Programmes to encourage the food industry to reduce salt in processed foods are highly recommended for improving population health and reducing health sector spending in the long term, but regulatory action from government may be needed to achieve the potential of significant improvements in population health.},

abstract={Reducing the intake of sodium is an important public health goal for Americans. Since the 1970s, an array of public health interventions and national dietary guidelines has sought to reduce sodium intake. However, the U.S. population still consumes more sodium than is recommended, placing individuals at risk for diseases related to elevated blood pressure. Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States evaluates and makes recommendations about strategies that could be implemented to reduce dietary sodium intake to levels recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The book reviews past and ongoing efforts to reduce the sodium content of the food supply and to motivate consumers to change behavior. Based on past lessons learned, the book makes recommendations for future initiatives. It is an excellent resource for federal and state public health officials, the processed food and food service industries, health care professionals, consumer advocacy groups, and academic researchers. © 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Coronary risk factors; such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco consumption, hypercholesterolemia and obesity as well as coronary artery disease (CAD) are a major health problems in developed as well as in developing economies. In developing economies, despite a moderate increase in fat intake and low rates of obesity, the risk of CAD is rapidly increasing. It is a paradox that in some of these countries the increased risk of people to diabetes and CAD, especially at a younger age, is difficult to explain by conventional risk factors. It is possible that the presence of new risk factors especially higher lipoprotein(a)(Lpa), hyperhomocysteinemia, insulin resistance, low high density lipoprotein cholesterol and poor nutrition during fetal life, infancy and childhood may explain at least in part, the cause of this paradox.The prevalence of obesity, central obesity, smoking, physical inactivity and stress are rapidly increasing in low and middle income populations, due to economic development. In high income populations, there is a decrease in tobacco consumption, increase in physical activity and dietary restrictions, due to learning of the message of prevention, resulting into reduction in coronary and sroke mortality. Hypertension,(5-10%) diabetes(3-5%) and CAD(3-4%) are very low in the adult, rural populations of India, China, and in the African sub-continent which has less economic development.However, in urban and immigrant populations of India and China, the prevalence of hypertension (>140/90, 25-30%), diabetes (6-18%) and CAD (7-14%) are significantly higher than they are in some of the high income populations. Mean serum cholesterol (180-200 mg/dl), obesity (5-8%) and dietary fat intake (25-30% en/day) are paradoxically not very high and do not explain the cause of increased susceptibility to CAD and diabetes in some South Asian countries. The force of lipid-related risk factors and refined starches and sugar appears to be greater in these populations due to the presence of the above factors and results into CVD at a younger age in these countries.These findings may require modification of the existing American and European guidelines, proposed for prevention of CAD, in high income populations. Wild foods or designer foods(400-500g/day) substitution (www.columbus-concept.com) for proatherogenic foods; refined carbohydrates, trans fatty acids, saturated fat and w-6 rich oils in conjunction with moderate physical activity and cessation of tobacco, may be protective against deaths and disability due to CVD and diabetes in most of these countries. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

Compared to a selective (high) risk strategy, the population strategy has the advantage of minimising the risk exposure of the total population and can help to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This is supported by the experiences of population wide salt reduction in Finland. According to current evidence, a moderate reduction of salt intake to 3-6 g/day induces no negative effects. A reduction of this sort is only possible with the support of food producers, who must increase the availability of food with reduced salt levels.},

abstract={Background: Restricting the dietary intake of sodium chloride is associated with a reduction of the arterial blood pressure by approxi mately 4/2 mm Hg in hypertensive patients and by approximately 1/0.6 mm Hg in normotensive persons. As the cardiovascular risk is known to rise steadily with systolic blood pressure values starting from 115 mm Hg, lowering the mean blood pressure of the general population by dietary salt restriction would seem to be a practicable form of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Method: Selective literature search and review. Results: Multiple studies have shown dietary salt restriction to be associated with lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The reduction of adjusted relative risk in controlled observational studies ranges from 25% over 15 years to 41% over three years. Conclusion: On the basis of the available studies, it seems likely that a moderate lowering of the daily intake of sodium chloride by the general population from 8 to 12 grams per day (the current value) to 5 to 6 grams per day would be a useful public health measure, with economic benefits as well. The potential risks for certain groups of individuals are foreseeable and controllable. A general reduction of dietary salt intake can only be achieved by reducing the sodium chloride content of in dustrially processed foods, as these account for 75% to 80% of the sodium chloride consumed daily. Aside from a general reduction of dietary salt intake, further important primary prevention measures for the general population include changes in lifestyle and in dietary habits.},

One possible approach to prevent hypertension would be to reduce the salt content of processed foods, as the population is exposed to high levels of salt. Adults, adolescents and children currently consume much more salt than the levels given as appropriate in the reference values of the German Nutritional Society. It can even be assumed that salt consumption has tended to be underestimated. Population-based reduction in salt consumption could make an important contribution to the prevention and therapy of arterial hypertension and protect children - who are at particular risk. This could be achieved by implementing the international recommended maximal levels of 6 g salt/day.},

abstract={Background: Dietary sodium, the major source being salt, is associated with hypertension. Australian adults consume more than the recommended amount of salt and approximately 15% of dietary sodium comes from salt added at the table and during cooking. Objective: To determine the frequency of and the demographic characteristics associated with discretionary salt use. Design: A cross sectional survey conducted in shopping centres within Metropolitan Melbourne. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing discretionary salt use and attitudes to salt intake. Outcomes: Four hundred and seventy four surveys were collected (65% female, 77% Caucasian, 64% holding a university qualification). Eighty nine percent of respondents were classified as salt users and 11% as non-salt users. Of the salt users 52% reported that they always or sometimes add salt during cooking and at the table. Those of Asian descent and younger respondents aged 18-24 years were more likely to be salt users (χ2=12.3, df=2, p&lt;0.001; χ2=19.2, df=5, p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: Discretionary salt use remains high. To successfully reduce population dietary salt intake public health campaigns are urgently required and need to include consumer advice to reduce discretionary salt use, whilst reducing the salt added to processed foods. Such campaigns should include younger age groups and should be appropriate for all ethnic backgrounds to raise the awareness of the risks of a high salt diet on health.},

abstract={Background: Sodium consumption raises blood pressure, increasing the risk for heart attack and stroke. Several countries, including the United States, are considering strategies to decrease population sodium intake. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 2 population strategies to reduce sodium intake: government collaboration with food manufacturers to voluntarily cut sodium in processed foods, modeled on the United Kingdom experience, and a sodium tax. Design: A Markov model was constructed with 4 health states: well, acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute stroke, and history of MI or stroke. Data Sources: Medical Panel Expenditure Survey (2006), Framingham Heart Study (1980 to 2003), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial, and other published data. Target Population: U.S. adults aged 40 to 85 years. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Outcome Measures: Incremental costs (2008 U.S. dollars), qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs), and MIs and strokes averted. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Collaboration with industry that decreases mean population sodium intake by 9.5% averts 513 885 strokes and 480 358 MIs over the lifetime of adults aged 40 to 85 years who are alive today compared with the status quo, increasing QALYs by 2.1 million and saving $32.1 billion in medical costs. A tax on sodium that decreases population sodium intake by 6% increases QALYs by 1.3 million and saves $22.4 billion over the same period. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results are sensitive to the assumption that consumers have no disutility with modest reductions in sodium intake. Limitation: Efforts to reduce population sodium intake could result in other dietary changes that are difficult to predict. Conclusion: Strategies to reduce sodium intake on a population level in the United States are likely to substantially reduce stroke and MI incidence, which would save billions of dollars in medical expenses.

abstract={Background: Randomized controlled studies over the last 4 decades demonstrated that controlling blood pressure could reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease. The relationship between diet ingredient (particularly the salt) and blood pressure has been well established and since bread is the main element in population diet, especially in our country, the determination of sodium content of bread is of high priority and warrants further investigation. Method: A total of 204 bakeries were selected for this study and the amount of salt in different bread was measured once during spring and summer, using the method of Iran's Organization for Standards and Industrial Investigation. The study was performed on 6 different kinds of bread baked in different districts of Shiraz city. Results: This study demonstrated that 17.9% of bread's salt level in Shiraz exceeds the standard level and the remaining 82.1% is within the standard range. Mean percentage of bread's salt was reported as 1.31 gram%. Conclusion: Compared to the previous reports, the results of present study fortunately showed a reduction of salt in bread during the last two decades. However, 17.9% of bread's salt is yet more than the standard level.},

abstract={Background: The U.S. diet is high in salt, with the majority coming from processed foods. Reducing dietary salt is a potentially important target for the improvement of public health. Methods: We used the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Policy Model to quantify the benefits of potentially achievable, population-wide reductions in dietary salt of up to 3 g per day (1200 mg of sodium per day). We estimated the rates and costs of cardiovascular disease in subgroups defined by age, sex, and race; compared the effects of salt reduction with those of other interventions intended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease; and determined the cost-effectiveness of salt reduction as compared with the treatment of hypertension with medications. Results: Reducing dietary salt by 3 g per day is projected to reduce the annual number of new cases of CHD by 60,000 to 120,000, stroke by 32,000 to 66,000, and myocardial infarction by 54,000 to 99,000 and to reduce the annual number of deaths from any cause by 44,000 to 92,000. All segments of the population would benefit, with blacks benefiting proportionately more, women benefiting particularly from stroke reduction, older adults from reductions in CHD events, and younger adults from lower mortality rates. The cardiovascular benefits of reduced salt intake are on par with the benefits of population-wide reductions in tobacco use, obesity, and cholesterol levels. A regulatory intervention designed to achieve a reduction in salt intake of 3 g per day would save 194,000 to 392,000 quality-adjusted life-years and $10 billion to $24 billion in health care costs annually. Such an intervention would be cost-saving even if only a modest reduction of 1 g per day were achieved gradually between 2010 and 2019 and would be more cost-effective than using medications to lower blood pressure in all persons with hypertension. Conclusions: Modest reductions in dietary salt could substantially reduce cardiovascular events and medical costs and should be a public health target. Copyright © 2010 Massachusetts Medical Society.

abstract={Context and objective: Preeclampsia and neural tube defects can be prevented during pregnancy. Today, there is level I evidence showing that calcium supplementation during pregnancy may prevent preeclampsia and that use of folic acid may prevent neural tube defects. The aim here was to evaluate the proportion of patients undergoing prenatal follow-up who had received a prescription for calcium and/or folic acid supplementation, and their adherence to the use of these two substances. Design And Setting: Cross-sectional study at two hospitals in the Greater São Paulo region, Brazil (Faculdade de Medicina da Fundação ABC, Santo André, and "Dr. Mário de Moraes Altenfelder Silva" Municipal Teaching and Maternity Hospital, Vila Nova Cachoeirinha). Methods: Early primigravidae, late primigravidae and pregnant women with chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease who had already had their first prenatal consultation were included. Results: Out of 250 pregnant women interviewed, 10.40% had received a prescription for calcium supplementation and 80.76% of them reported taking it in tablet form. Regarding folic acid, 48% of the women said that they had received a prescription for this and 64.16% reported that they had started to use it during the periconceptional period. Conclusions: Calcium supplementation and periconceptional use of folic acid seem not to be prescribed routinely by physicians. This should motivate the implementation of educational programs for obstetricians on the use of interventions based on the best available evidence.},

abstract={Cardiovascular diseases are a major public health problem worldwide. They are the main cause of death in industrialized countries, while the mortality associated with cardiovascular disease is increasing in less developed countries. The modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease are cigarette smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Obesity has been recorded in 10%-25% of the population, indicating that poor or inappropriate diet is one of the most common causes of cardiovascular disease. Unhealthy dietary habits including place and way of taking meals, number of daily meals and excessive salt intake from processed foods also contribute to body mass gain. In the present study, dietary habits were assessed in cardiovascular patients versus control group by use of Dietary Habits Questionnaire. Study results showed a statistically significantly higher (P<0.05) prevalence of inappropriate eating habits in cardiovascular patients (lower number of daily meals, more often skipping breakfast and having dinner) than in control group. In conclusion, many lifestyle and individual behavior modifications are needed in most patients with or at a high risk of cardiovascular disease.},

Every known (acquired or genetic) cause of hypertension can be explained by an alteration of this curve. Reduction of salt intake therefore represents an effective tool for lowering arterial blood pressure. With respect to public health, a lower salt content in processed food would be a highly efficient and cost effective intervention for the reduction of cardiovascular mortality (opposed by the food industry). Reducing salt intake to below 100 mmol/day (6 g NaCl) lowers blood pressure and strengthens the potential of almost all antihypertensive medication. Reduction of salt intake can, in many cases, be achieved by avoiding adding salt to daily food, in other cases specialized diet counselling is necessary. Reduction of salt intake attenuates thirst, which can be in contradiction with the (unjustified) recommendation to drink 2-3 litres of water per day. © 2009 by Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG.},

abstract={HBP (high blood pressure) is the leading risk of death in the world. Unfortunately around the world, blood pressure levels are predicted to become even higher, especially in developing countries. High dietary salt is an important contributor to increased blood pressure. The present review evaluates the association between excess dietary salt intake and the importance of a population-based strategy to lower dietary salt, and also highlights some salt-reduction strategies from selected countries. Evidence from diverse sources spanning animal, epidemiology and human intervention studies demonstrate the association between salt intake and HBP. Furthermore, animal studies indicate that short-term interventions in humans may underestimate the health risks associated with high dietary sodium. Recent intervention studies have found decreases in cardiovascular events following reductions in dietary sodium. Salt intake is high in most countries and, therefore, strategies to lower salt intake could be an effective means to reduce the increasing burden of HBP and the associated cardiovascular disease. Effective collaborative partnerships between governments, the food industry, scientific organizations and healthcare organizations are essential to achieve the WHO (World Health Organization)-recommended population-wide decrease in salt consumption to less than 5 g/day. In the milieu of increasing cardiovascular disease worldwide, particularly in resource-constrained low- and middle-income countries, salt reduction is one of the most cost-effective strategies to combat the epidemic of HBP, associated cardiovascular disease and improve population health. © The Authors Journal compilation.},

abstract={A potassium chloride-containing salt substitute lowers blood pressure levels, but its overall acceptability has been of concern due to its potential adverse effects on food taste. In a large-scale, blinded randomised trial evaluating the comparative effects of a salt substitute (65% sodium chloride, 25% potassium chloride and 10% magnesium sulphate) and a normal salt (100% sodium chloride) on blood pressure, we collected data on the saltiness, flavour and overall acceptability of food. We performed this at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months post-randomisation using 100mm visual analogue scales for assessments of both home-cooked foods and a standard salty soup. The mean age of the 608 participants from rural northern China was 60 years and 56% of them were females. In the primary analyses, the changes in the saltiness, flavour and overall acceptability of both home-cooked foods and a standard salty soup were not different between the randomised groups (all P>0.08). In the secondary analyses, weighting each of the data points according to the lengths of the respective follow-up intervals, the flavour of both home-cooked foods (mean difference =- 1.8 mm, P=0.045) and a standard salty soup (mean difference = 1.9 mm, P=0.03) was slightly weaker in the salt substitute group. We conclude that salt substitution is both an effective and an acceptable means of blood pressure control. Possible small differences in flavour did not importantly deter the use of the salt substitute in this study group, although the acceptability of the salt substitute by a more general population group would need to be confirmed.},

abstract={Salt in the human diet is a major risk factor for hypertension and many countries have set targets to reduce salt consumption. Technological solutions are being sought to lower the salt content of processed foods without altering their taste. In this study, the approach was to deliver salt solutions in pulses of different concentrations to determine whether a pulsed delivery profile affected sensory perception of salt. Nine different salt profiles were delivered by a Dynataste device and a trained panel assessed their saltiness using time-intensity and single-score sensory techniques. The profile duration (15 s) was designed to match eating conditions and the effects of intensity and duration of the pulses on sensory perception were investigated. Sensory results from the profiles delivered in either water or in a bouillon base were not statistically different. Maximum perceived salt intensities and the area under the time-intensity curves correlated well with the overall perceived saltiness intensity despite the stimulus being delivered as several pulses. The overall saltiness scores for profiles delivering the same overall amount of sodium were statistically not different from one another suggesting that, in this system, pulsed delivery did not enhance salt perception but the overall amount of salt delivered in each profile did affect sensory perception. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Pediatric arterial hypertension (AH) is an underdiagnosed disease, with a known prevalence of 2-3%. Its preventive management should begin early and includes life-style changes and diet salt reduction to a maximum of 5.8 g (2.3 g of sodium), since there is a direct relationship between total salt intake and arterial blood pressure. It has been previously shown that in populations with low salt diet (less than 3g), AH is rare and it does not increase with age. It has been estimated that 77% of salt found in regular diets comes from processed food. Mechanisms involved in salt intake and high blood pressure are analyzed in this paper. Arterial hypertension secondary to renal diseases and other pathologies are excluded. Considering renal physiology, the role of the kidney is crucial in arterial blood pressure regulation, through the capacity to affect the salt and water excretion; therefore, controlling total blood volume. The relationship between salt and AH in the newborn and older children, as well as genetic aspects of this disease, are discussed. In conclusion, there are biological and behavioural risk factors that can be modified in young population. It is necessary to promote these changes through active, as well as passive, prevention strategies. A government public health policy including educational publicity campaigns, permanent media information and accessible health food labelling is essential. Habits, old customs and trends need to be changed through a multifactorial approach to groups, families and community. The pediatrician should lead this effort.},

abstract={Purpose. Policies that address the food environment at the population level may help prevent chronic disease, but their value to society is still uncertain. Dietary sodium is linked to increased prevalence of hypertension, a primary risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases. This study calculates the potential societal savings of reducing hypertension and related cardiovascular disease via a reduction in population-level sodium intake. On average, U.S. adults consume almost twice the recommended maximum of dietary sodium, most of it from processed foods. Design. This study modeled sodium-reduction scenarios by using a cross-sectional simulation approach. The model used population-level data on blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, and sodium intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004). This data was then combined with parameters from the literature on sodium effects, disease outcomes, costs, and quality of life to yield model outcomes. Measures. This study calculated the following outcome measures: hypertension prevalence, direct health care costs, and quality-adjusted life years for noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. Analysis. The simulation was conducted with STATA 9.2 and Microsoft Excel. Survey weights were used to calculate population averages. Results. Reducing average population sodium intake to 2300 mg per day, the recommended maximum for adults, may reduce cases of hypertension by 11 million, save $18 billion health care dollars, and gain 312,000 QALYs that are worth $32 billion annually. Greater reductions in population sodium consumption bring even greater savings to society. Conclusions. Large benefits to society may result from efforts to lower sodium consumption on a population level by modest amounts over time. Although savings in direct health care costs are likely to be quite high, they could easily be matched or exceeded by the value of quality-of-life improvements.

abstract={Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Raised blood pressure (BP), cholesterol and smoking, are the major risk factors. Among these, raised BP is the most important cause, accounting for 62% of strokes and 49% of coronary heart disease. Importantly, the risk is throughout the range of BP, starting at systolic 115 mm Hg. There is strong evidence that our current consumption of salt is the major factor increasing BP and thereby CVD. Furthermore, a high salt diet may have direct harmful effects independent of its effect on BP, for example, increasing the risk of stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy and renal disease. Increasing evidence also suggests that salt intake is related to obesity through soft drink consumption, associated with renal stones and osteoporosis and is probably a major cause of stomach cancer. In most developed countries, a reduction in salt intake can be achieved by a gradual and sustained reduction in the amount of salt added to food by the food industry. In other countries where most of the salt consumed comes from salt added during cooking or from sauces, a public health campaign is needed to encourage consumers to use less salt. Several countries have already reduced salt intake, for example, Japan (1960-1970), Finland (1975 onwards) and now the United Kingdom. The challenge is to spread this out to all other countries. A modest reduction in population salt intake worldwide will result in a major improvement in public health.},

abstract={Background: Right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction is frequently used to repair cardiac malformations. However, the lifetime of these conduits is short and stent implantation is a good option to relieve obstructed RVOT. The objective of this study is to report the experience of a tertiary center with non-valved stent implantation and its short and medium term results. Methods: Between September 1990 and January 2009, 11 late postoperative patients were submitted to stent implantation due to RVOT obstruction. Mean age at the time of procedure was 12.5 ± 8.3 years (1-28 years), and mean weight was 35 ± 20.9 kg (6-62 kg). Mean follow-up time was 12.5 ± 6 months (0-48 months). Results: Mean systolic right ventricular pressures decreased from 99 ± 23 mmHg before to 57 ± 12 mmHg (p < 0.001) after stent implantation. At echocardiogram, RV to PA gradient decreased from 69 ± 19 mmHg to 33 ± 20 mmHg (p < 0.01). Forty percent of the patients required percutaneous or surgical reintervention during a mean time of 22 months after the procedure. There was one case of stent fracture, relieved with the implantation of another stent, one case of failure, and one death not related to the procedure. Conclusion: Non-valved stent implantation in obstructed RVOT is a highly effective and safe palliative approach. Moreover, it allows the somatic growth of young patients and does not preclude future percutaneous implantation of valved stents to treat free pulmonary regurgitation.},

abstract={Restricting salt intake not only leads to a decrease of blood pressure and a reduction in the incidence of arterial hypertension but also to a fall in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. But high sodium intake is not only a risk factor for hypertension but also for cardiovascular diseases. Moderate reduction of daily salt intake in the entire population of Germany from the present level of 8-10 mg to 5-6 mg is of great benefit for disease load and to the economy. Any possible risk for a few groups of persons is predictable and can be coped with. General sodium reduction cannot be achieved only by individual advice, instruction or information campaigns but requires a reduction in the sodium content of industrially processed foods, in fast-food chains, restaurants and canteens because they supply 80% of total daily sodium intake. To achieve the target of restricting the sodium intake of the whole population it is recommended that an interdisciplinary and interprofessional task force, "Less salt for all" be established. This is to bring together the expertise of scientific societies and institutions that see their main task in the reduction of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity by primary prevention. Individual prevention in patients at risk can be very significantly improved by population-related preventive measures. These include, in addition to general limitation of sodium intake, continuing change in lifestyle.},

abstract={Objectives: To determine the relationship of demographics to opinions and knowledge of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, and dietary intake and to evaluate the relationship of dietary knowledge and dietary behaviors in rural African American adults. Methods: The cross-sectional study involved a sample of participants who attended one of three cardiovascular information seminars in rural Macon County, Alabama. A total of 127 African American men and women, aged 21-75 years, completed a self-administered 79- item questionnaire. Data analysis included Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Outcome Measures: Agreement or disagreement with current scientific opinion regarding coronary heart disease, obesity, and dietary intake; agreement with statements of personal knowledge of heart disease, hypertension, and dietary intake; assessment and beliefs about the health risks associated with overweight/ obesity; and congruence between dietary knowledge and dietary practices. Results: Women and older respondents tended to agree more with current scientific knowledge about heart disease mortality than did men and younger respondents. Younger respondents reported knowledge but less personal concern about fat intake/heart disease and salt intake/hypertension associations than did other age groups. Participants generally believed that excess weight increased the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer "a lot." Knowledge of the salt content of processed foods was associated with decreased frequency of adding salt at the table, while those not concerned about salt consumption and hypertension were more likely to add salt and consume processed meats. Respondents with knowledge of the effects of fat intake on heart disease were more likely to consume low-fat dairy products. Conclusions: The findings suggest that sex and age, in particular, require consideration in the development of community cardiovascular disease intervention programs aimed at southern, rural African American adults.},

abstract={A systematic review of the literature suggests the dietary habits of some ethnic groups living in Europe are likely to become less healthy as individuals increase consumption of processed foods that are energy dense and contain high levels of fat, sugar, and salt. Such products often replace healthy dietary components of the native diet, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. Mixed food habits are emerging mainly amongst younger people in the second and third generations, most likely due to acculturation and adoption of a Western lifestyle. Age and immigrant generation are the major factors accounting for changes in dietary habits, whilst income, level of education, dietary laws, religion, and food beliefs are also important factors. Obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension present major problems for the mainstream European population. However, the risk of chronic disease is reported to be higher in ethnic populations, particularly South Asians, African Caribbeans, and Mexicans. © 2008 International Life Sciences Institute.},

abstract={Prescribing "salt restriction" for patients with salt-related health problems - using diets measuring sodium content and portion sizes - has been notoriously unpopular and unreliable, and the only therapeutic alternative has been to prescribe diuretics. This article reports a new observation that total salt intake is low enough (sodium < 50 mmol/ day) to be more effective and less troublesome than diuretics in people who follow the Australian dietary guideline to choose foods low in salt while using the definition of low salt foods in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (Na ≤120 mg/100g). Low salt foods - eaten exclusively during human evolution - can usually abolish the severe vertigo of Meniere's disorder as the sole treatment, and reverse the universal rise of blood pressure with age, preventing hypertension. This simple prescription for better food (a healthier salt intake) enables health professionals to obtain measurable and permanent clinical improvement in motivated patients. The full public health potential of better food will require a long period of gradual reform in food processing and the evolution of a new cuisine. Shoppers must know what they are buying, and Australia needs Britain's traffic light labels that identify low salt foods at a glance with green lights for salt.},

It has been predicted that these diseases will increase rapidly in India and this country will be host to more than half the cases of heart disease in the world within the next 15 years. Coronary heart disease and stroke have increased in both urban and rural areas. Case-control studies indicate that tobacco use, obesity with high waist:hip ratio, high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, abnormal apolipoprotein A-1:B ratio, diabetes, low consumption of fruits and vegetables, sedentary lifestyles and psychosocial stress are important determinants of cardiovascular diseases in India. These risk factors have increased substantially over the past 50 years and to control further escalation it is important to prevent them. National interventions such as increasing tobacco taxes, labelling unhealthy foods and trans fats, reduction of salt in processed foods and better urban design to promote physical activity may have a wide short-term impact.},

abstract={Across populations, the level of blood pressure, the incremental rise in blood pressure with age, and the prevalence of hypertension are directly related to sodium intake. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials document a consistent effect of sodium consumption on blood pressure. The majority of sodium consumption in the United States is derived from amounts added during food processing and preparation. Leading scientific organizations and governmental agencies advise limiting sodium intake to 2400 mg or less daily (approximately 6000 mg of salt). Substantial public health benefits accrue from small reductions in the population blood pressure distribution. A 1.3-g/d lower lifetime sodium intake translates into an approximately 5-mm Hg smaller rise in systolic blood pressure as individuals advance from 25 to 55 years of age, a reduction estimated to save 150 000 lives annually. With an appropriate food industry response, combined with consumer education and knowledgeable use of food labels, the average consumer should be able to choose a lower-sodium diet without inconvenience or loss of food enjoyment. In the continued absence of voluntary measures adopted by the food industry, new regulations will be required to achieve lower sodium concentrations in processed and prepared foods. ©2007 American Medical Association.

abstract={This article presents results of a community-based participatory study (DASH of Soul) designed to produce soul food that meets the nutrient criteria of the DASH diet plan. DASH of Soul was tested during a 10-month period with two sub-groups of low-income African American women: 1) a focus group cooking club recruited from among "early adopters" of a previous intervention; and 2) a broader peer group dinner club recruited through a health center serving the neighborhood of the focus group. Methods for the cooking club included 10 filmed cooking labs to: a) modify traditional soul food (MSF) to reduce food energy, total fat, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium; b) evaluate and improve upon sensory acceptability; c) integrate acceptable MSF into the DASH diet plan (MS-DASH); d) produce VHS-and DVD-formatted MS-DASH cooking shows. Methods for the dinner club included monthly participation in weekly promotional dinner meetings that featured the cooking show and a different DASH food group each month for 8 months. Based on computer software analysis, the nutrient composition of a sample MS-DASH menu developed by the cooking club was consistent with nutrient levels for the DASH diet plan. The authors concluded from the focus group interviews and intercept surveys that, with continued motivation, the potential is good for the study population to make MS-DASH a lifestyle choice, reducing their risks for diet-related diseases that cluster to comprise metabolic syndrome.},

abstract={Diet influences many modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Considering this, moderation of total dietary fat, particularly trans and saturated fats, as well as cholesterol is recommended. Dietary fats should come mainly from plants and fatty fish, providing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated (including omega-3) fatty acids. Carbohydrate sources to emphasize include whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and other fiber-rich sources, rather than sugars. Although vitamins such as E, C, and some B vitamins are associated with reduced CVD risk, data do not support the use of supplements, but foods rich in these nutrients are advocated. Dietary minerals such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium may be beneficial to heart health, while reduction of dietary sodium decreases risk of hypertension. A large variety of phytonutrients are also associated with reduced CVD risk. Other dietary factors receiving research attention regarding CVD risk. Other dietary factors receiving research attention regarding CVD risk include caffeine, alcobol, and meal frequency, although more work is needed in these areas. In contrast, data are quite robust to support the importance of healthy body weight management in cardiovascular health. In general, diets based on a variety of less processed foods, mainly of plant origin, in the context of an active lifestyle, are conducive to heart health. © 2007, SAGE Publications.

abstract={Salt is a chemical that consists of sodium and chloride and, as something added to food, is not a normal constituent of a human’s or any mammal’s diet. For several million years the evolutionary ancestors of humans ate a diet that contained less than 0.25 g/day of salt (1). Sufficient sodium exists in natural foods to ensure that mammals could develop away from the sea. However, chemical salt has played an important role in the development of civilization (2). It was first found to have the magical property of preserving foods, probably by the Chinese around 5000 years ago, when they found that meat or fish could be preserved for a long time when they were soaked in saline solutions. This ability to preserve food allowed the development of settled communities. Salt became one of the most traded commodities in the world, as well as one of the most taxed. Salt was initially expensive to produce and was regarded as a luxury, but with the mining of salt it became much more plentiful and was added to fresh food as this food tasted bland compared to the highly salted preserved foods that most people were used to eating. It was also found that when salt was added to food that was going putrid, the bitter flavors were removed and the food became edible. Salt was seen as almost magical and became a symbol of purity in most religions. In the late nineteenth century deep freezers and refrigerators were invented and salt lost its importance as a preservative. Since that time salt intake has been gradually falling. However, with the increased consumption of processed, restaurant, and fast foods, which contain large amounts of hidden salt, salt intake is now increasing. More than threequarters of salt intake in most developed countries now comes from salt added to processed foods (3). © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The kidneys play a major role in the regulation of the salt balance and thereby regulate blood pressure. Salt sensitivity is acquired or genetically-induced and is noted in about 50% of patients with essential hypertension. This property leads to a high cardiovascular risk. In this situation, the benefit of salt restriction is significant, and this dietary change should be associated with a high potassium intake. In patients treated by antihypertensive drugs, salt restriction improves the blood pressure control, which can permit a reduction of the number of drugs required to achieve a normal blood pressure. The recommended maximal salt intake should not exceed 6 grams/day (NaCl). Because most dietary salt comes from processed foods, the help of the food industry is crucial for a long-term compliance with a reduced salt intake, which could yield an additional important benefit in the reduction of cardiovascular risk.},

abstract={The prevalence of hypertension is high and increasing worldwide. Drug therapy is effective, but for both "prehypertensive" and treated hypertensive patients, lifestyle changes are also important. Dietary modification is a key part of these changes, although skepticism about the role of diet in determining blood pressure has slowed implementation of the available guidelines. However, there is now a large body of evidence supporting a role for dietary salt, potassium, alcohol, and body mass in determining blood pressure. Studies such as PREMIER have shown that salt restriction (<6 g/d), alcohol moderation (<2U/d in men and <1U/d in women), weight loss (if BMI>25), exercise, and a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet (supplying 20-30 mmol/d of potassium) can achieve decreases in systolic blood pressure of approximately 10 to 15 mm Hg when applied together. Of the dietary changes, salt intake remains the most amenable to change. But we must further reduce salt in processed food if it is to be part of a wider strategy to lower blood pressure in the general population. Nevertheless, the message to patients must be that dietary changes made within a concerted alteration in lifestyle can have a very significant impact on their blood pressure.

abstract={Background: In Africa hypertension is common and stroke is increasing. Detection, treatment and control of high blood pressure (BP) is limited. BP can be lowered by reducing salt intake. In Africa salt is added to the food by the consumer, as processed food is rare. A population-wide approach with programmes based on health education and promotion is thus possible. Methods: We carried out a community-based cluster randomised trial of health promotion in 1,013 participants from 12 villages (628 women, 481 rural dwellers); mean age 55 years to reduce salt intake and BP. Average BP was 125/74 mmHg and urinary sodium (UNa) 101 mmol/day. A health promotion intervention was provided over 6 months to all villages. Assessments were made at 3 and 6 months. Primary end-points were urinary sodium excretion and BP levels. Results: There was a significant positive relationship between salt intake and both systolic (2.17 mmHg [95% CI 0.44 to 3.91] per 50 mmol of UNa per day, p < 0.001) and diastolic BP (1.10 mmHg [0.08 to 1.94], p < 0.001) at baseline. At six months the intervention group showed a reduction in systolic (2.54 mmHg [-1.45 to 6.54]) and diastolic (3.95 mmHg [0.78 to 7.11], p = 0.015) BP when compared to control. There was no significant change in UNa. Smaller villages showed greater reductions in UNa than larger villages (p = 0.042). Irrespective of randomisation, there was a consistent and significant relationship between change in UNa and change in systolic BP, when adjusted for confounders. A difference in 24-hour UNa of 50 mmol was associated with a lower systolic BP of 2.12 mmHg (1.03 to 3.21) at 3 months and 1.34 mmHg (0.08 to 2.60) at 6 months (both p < 0.001). Conclusion: In West Africa the lower the salt intake, the lower the BP. It would appear that a reduction in the average salt intake in the whole community may lead to a small but significant reduction in population systolic BP. © 2006 Cappuccio et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction: Doppler echocardiography is usually performed when assessing a patient with severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT), since it enables accurate determination of the severity of the hypertension through evaluation of several morphologic and hemodynamic variables. Echocardiograms are usually performed in left lateral decubitus (LLD). However, symptoms often arise only in a standing position and particularly during exercise. Objective: To evaluate a group of patients with severe PHT using Doppler echocardiography during treadmill exercise testing. Methods: We studied 8 patients (group A), mean age 43.88 ± 14 years, 7 women; three had idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, 2 pulmonary thromboembolic disease, 2 Eisenmenger syndrome, and one pulmonary hypertension associated with celiac disease. We also studied an 8-patient control group (group B) with similar demographic characteristics, who had tricuspid regurgitation but no known cardiac disease, including pulmonary hypertension (excluded by echocardiogram). In addition to the ergometric variables of stress test duration using the modified Bruce protocol, resting heart rate, peak heart rate (PHR), resting systolic blood pressure (RSBP) and peak systolic blood pressure (PSBP), we evaluated the following echocardiographic variables: pressure gradient between right ventricle and right atrium (RV/RAg) and systolic volume (SV) in left lateral decubitus, in a standing position (SP) and at peak workload (PW). Stress testing was stopped in cases of fatigue and/or dyspnea. Results: In group A, the RV/RAg in LLD was 100 ± 20 mmHg, 98 ± 20 mmHg in SP (p = NS) and 129 ± 27 mmHg at PW (p = 0.003 vs. SP). In group B, the RV/RAg in LLD was 19.8 ± 3.5 mmHg, 14.6 ± 2.1 mmHg in SP (p = 0.0005) and 29.5 ± 3.3 mmHg at PW (p < 0.0001 vs. SP). In group A, SV was 38 ± 11 ml in LLD, 35 ± 10 ml in SP and 32 ± 9 ml at PW (p = NS); in group B, it was 63 ± 5 ml in LLD, 55 ± 5 ml in SP and 64 ± 7 ml at PW (p < 0.0001). PHR was 114 ± 10 bpm in group A and 145 ± 8 (p < 0.0001) in group B. RSBP was 113 ± 13 mmHg and PSBP 112 ± 21 mmHg (p = NS) in group A, and 116 ± 18 mmHg and 161 ± 25 mmHg respectively (p < 0.0001) in group B. In four patients from group A, symptomatic falls in systolic blood pressure and SV occurred at PW. During a mean follow-up of 27 months (between 6 and 44 months), two of these four patients died and one is awaiting lung transplantation. Conclusions: 1. RV/RAg did not diminish in the standing position and rose significantly with orthostatic isotonic exercise during exercise testing in patients with severe PHT, with pulmonary artery systolic pressure reaching suprasystemic values. 2. Systolic volume and systolic blood pressure did not rise during exercise in patients with severe PHT, and patients with a decrease in systolic volume had worse clinical evolution. 3. Patients with severe PHT appeared to have chronotropic incompetence during exercise compared to the control group.},

abstract={The present average sodium intakes, approximately 3000-4500 mg/day in various industrialised populations, are very high, that is, 2-3-fold in comparison with the current Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of 1500 mg. The sodium intakes markedly exceed even the level of 2500 mg, which has been recently given as the maximum level of daily intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects on blood pressure or otherwise. By contrast, the present average potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes are remarkably lower than the recommended intake levels (DRI). In USA, for example, the average intake of these mineral nutrients is only 35-50% of the recommended intakes. There is convincing evidence, which indicates that this imbalance, that is, the high intake of sodium on one hand and the low intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium on the other hand, produce and maintain elevated blood pressure in a big proportion of the population. Decreased intakes of sodium alone, and increased intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium each alone decrease elevated blood pressure. A combination of all these factors, that is, decrease of sodium, and increase of potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes, which are characteristic of the so-called Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets, has an excellent blood pressure lowering effect. For the prevention and basic treatment of elevated blood pressure, various methods to decrease the intake of sodium and to increase the intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium should be comprehensively applied in the communities. The so-called 'functional food/nutraceutical/food-ceutical' approach, which corrects the mineral nutrient composition of extensively used processed foods, is likely to be particularly effective in producing immediate beneficial effects. The European Union and various governments should promote the availability and use of such healthier food compositions by tax reductions and other policies, which make the healthier choices cheaper than the conventional ones. They should also introduce and promote the use of tempting nutrition and health claims on the packages of healthier food choices, which have an increased content of potassium, calcium, and/or magnesium and a lowered content of sodium. Such pricing and claim methods would help the consumers to choose healthier food alternatives, and make composition improvements tempting also for the food industry. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations concerning the maximum sodium levels permitted for foods that bear the implied nutrient content claim "healthy." The agency is retaining the currently effective, less restrictive, "first-tier" sodium level requirements for all food categories, including individual foods (480 milligrams (mg)) and meals and main dishes (600 mg), and is dropping the "second-tier" (more restrictive) sodium level requirements for all food categories. Based on the comments received about technological barriers to reducing sodium in processed foods and poor sales of products that meet the second-tier sodium level, the agency has determined that requiring the more restrictive sodium levels would likely inhibit the development of new "healthy" food products and risk substantially eliminating existing "healthy" products from the marketplace. After reviewing the comments and evaluating the data from various sources, FDA has become convinced that retaining the higher first-tier sodium level requirements for all food products bearing the term "healthy" will encourage the manufacture of a greater number of products that are consistent with dietary guidelines for a variety of nutrients. The agency has also revised the regulatory text of the "healthy" regulation to clarify the scope and meaning of the regulation and to reformat the nutrient content requirements for "healthy" into a more readable set of tables, consistent with the Presidential Memorandum instructing that regulations be written in plain language.},

abstract={The food industry is currently under pressure from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to deliver reductions in the salt intake of the population through the introduction of lower salt levels in processed foods (Gilbert & Heisler 2004 in same issue). Government research indicates that meat and meat products as a category are the second largest contributor to dietary salt after cereal products. This use of a combined category of 'meat and meat products' is misleading, as carcase meat is naturally low in sodium and therefore salt. Salt is added to meat products for a variety of technical reasons, including microbiological safety. There is evidence that consumers are confused about the difference between the terms 'sodium' and 'salt'. Analysis of products for labelling purposes therefore requires careful consideration to ensure that misleading information is not presented. While the debate about the role of salt in blood pressure control will no doubt continue, the British meat industry has committed to reducing the salt, or more specifically sodium, content of its products. To this end an action plan for sodium reduction in meat products has been developed which focuses on those products with the highest sodium contents and encourages producers to seek opportunities to reduce the sodium content of all meat products. © 2005 British Nutrition Foundation.},

abstract={Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the prevention of which is acknowledged to be critically important. Human beings are the only animal species which consume large quantities of salt, and their consumption has increased with the advancement of civilization. Many observational and interventional epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a high intake of salt results in elevation of blood pressure, and that a salt-reduced diet induces blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension as well as in individuals with normal blood pressure. Reduced salt intake, blood pressure reduction, and a remarkable decrease in mortality due to stroke in Japan are important examples of this effect. A decrease in the mean blood pressure in an entire population can contribute significantly to decreased incidence of cardiovascular diseases. A population-based strategy for preventing hypertension, including a salt-reduced diet, is therefore desirable. Proposed measures include public health education by the mass media, reduced salt content in processed foods, salt reduction in foods served by schools or organizations and at restaurants, and labeling of salt content. Further studies are needed of population-wide salt reduction methods, and the effectiveness of such methods.},

abstract={Diuretics have been used for treatment of arterial hypertension for about 50 years. It was found that diuretics deteriorate glucose utilisation, increase uricaemia, lead to hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyponatraemia and to dyslipoproteinaemias, which resulted in a significant reduction in use. This state still exists despite finding that the incidence curve of the adverse effects of diuretics resembles the Greek character sigma. It rises exponentially with dose increasing. Dose decreasing leads to the lowering of the adverse effects risk. In addition, controlled studies confirmed the beneficial effect of diuretics to s.c. major cardiovascular aims, including left ventricular hypertrophy regression. The 2003 Guidelines for hypertension treatment JNC VII and EHS/ESC indicate diuretics as antihypertensives of first choice and, at the same time, to be the most suitable remedy when combined with all other types of antihypertensives. Indapamid diuretics are characterized by dominant vasodilating and mild diuretic effects, slightly limiting mobility and thus improving compliance of patients. The effect of indapamid on sugar and fat metabolism is neutral. Indapamid SR 1.5 mg/tbl with controlled release (compared with indapamid IR 2.5 mg/tbl) does not only mean a 40% lower dose and thus the lowering of adverse effects risk, but in a dosage of 1tbl a day it has better pharmacokinetics and a more stable plasmatic level. According to FDA data the indapamid SR concentration at the end of administration (T/P rate) reaches 89%. Indapamid is safe and tolerated even by high risk patients who underwent NCMP (studies PATS, PROGRESS). However, it is not suitable for treatment of cardiac failure. It fulfills the criteria of antihypertensive of first choice and the ideal drug to be combined: the best combination with ACEI. Indapamid SR and perindopril have been chosen for the HYVET study which is observing the effects of antihypertensive therapy in patients over 80 years of age.},

abstract={Evidence for a relation between salt (and more generally sodium) intake and blood pressure has accumulated over the last years. First, cross-country epidemiologic studies showed that blood pressure is higher in populations with a high salt intake and that blood pressure increases after migration from rural zones to cities when associated with changes in the alimentary habits. Second, many trials show that lowering salt intake acutely or chronically lowers blood pressure both in man and in animals. To these arguments, one may add the point of view that there is a clear discrepancy between our genes and our present-time diet although it is noteworthy that sensitivity to salt (blood pressure response to changes in the sodium diet) varies in individuals. Salt intake in France has been evaluated from measurement of urinary sodium excretion and alimentary inquests. It can be estimated to 7-10 g per day as a mean, thus markedly higher than the physiological requirement which does not exceed 3 g per day. Salt is essentially present in bread, cheeses and dairy products, pork-meat products and processed food. Discretionary salt which is one of the vectors of alimentary iodine represents a small fraction of salt intake. It is thus difficult for individuals to modify their salt intake. High blood pressure prevalence is elevated in the French population and the Nutrition Health National Program has for objective to reduce by 10 mm Hg systolic blood pressure in adults over a five year period by proposing an appropriate mode of life, in particular the reduction of salt intake in heavy consumers. Since it is difficult to focus the intervention only on this group, it seems more adequate to privilege a population approach in order to diminish salt intake by 20 % over 5 years. To this aim, the National Academy of Medicine recommends : 1 - cooperation between government and food industry to ensure a stepwise reduction of salt in commonly consumed processed foods ; 2 - appropriate labelling about salt content in pre-packaged products ; 3 - information of the consumers on the risk of a high salt intake including the advice to suppress table salt ; 4 - maintenance of a sufficient iodine intake by addition of iodide to salt utilized in processed food ; 5 - epidemiological studies to evaluate the results of this policy on the salt intake and on the hypertension prevalence in the French population.},

abstract={Cereals are the edible seeds or grains of the grass family, Gramineae. A number of cereals are grown in different countries, including rye, oats, barley, maize, triticale, millet and sorghum. On a worldwide basis, wheat and rice are the most important crops, accounting for over 50% of the world's cereal production. All of the cereals share some structural similarities and consist of an embryo (or germ), which contains the genetic material for a new plant, and an endosperm, which is packed with starch grains. After harvest, correct storage of the grain is important to prevent mould spoilage, pest infestation and grain germination. If dry grains are held for only a few months, minimum nutritional changes will take place, but if the grains are held with a higher amount of moisture, the grain quality can deteriorate because of starch degradation by grain and microbial amylases (enzymes). Milling is the main process associated with cereals, although a range of other techniques are also used to produce a variety of products. Slightly different milling processes are used for the various grains, but the process can generally be described as grinding, sifting, separation and regrinding. The final nutrient content of a cereal after milling will depend on the extent to which the outer bran and aleurone layers are removed, as this is where the fibre, vitamins and minerals tend to be concentrated. There is potential for contamination of cereals and cereal products by pests, mycotoxins, rusts and smuts. Recently, acrylamide (described as a probable carcinogen) has been found in starchy baked foods. No link between acrylamide levels in food and cancer risk has been established and based on the evidence to date, the UK Food Standards Agency has advised the public not to change their diet or cooking methods. However, the Scientific Committee on Food of the European Union (EU) has endorsed recommendations made by Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Health Organization which include researching the possibility of reducing levels of acrylamide in food by changes in formulation and processing. Cereals have a long history of use by humans. Cereals are staple foods, and are important sources of nutrients in both developed and developing countries. Cereals and cereal products are an important source of energy, carbohydrate, protein and fibre, as well as containing a range of micronutrients such as vitamin E, some of the B vitamins, magnesium and zinc. In the UK, because of the mandatory fortification of some cereal products (e.g. white flour and therefore white bread) and the voluntary fortification of others (e.g. breakfast cereals), cereals also contribute significant amounts of calcium and iron. Cereals and cereal products may also contain a range of bioactive substances and there is growing interest in the potential health benefits these substances may provide. Further research is required in this area, including identification of other substances within cereals and their bioavailability. There is evidence to suggest that regular consumption of cereals, specifically wholegrains, may have a role in the prevention of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes and colorectal cancer. The exact mechanisms by which cereals convey beneficial effects on health are not clear. It is likely that a number of factors may be involved, e.g. their micronutrient content, their fibre content and/or their glycaemic index. As there may be a number of positive health effects associated with eating wholegrain cereals, encouraging their consumption seems a prudent public health approach. To increase consumption of wholegrain foods, it may be useful to have a quantitative recommendation. Additionally, a wider range of wholegrain foods that are quick and easy to prepare would help people increase their consumption of these foods. As cereal products currently contribute a considerable proportion of the sodium intake of the UK population, manufacturers need to continue to reduce the sodium content of foods such as breakfast cereals and breads where possible. Nutrition labelling is currently not mandatory in the UK, although many manufacturers provide information voluntarily. The fibre content of most UK foods is still measured using the Englyst method rather than the American Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC) method used by other EU countries and the USA. However, UK recommendations for fibre intake currently relate to fibre measured by the Englyst method and not the AOAC method, and hence need revisions. EU changes to labelling regulations will see the labelling of common foods and ingredients causing allergic reactions, including cereals containing gluten and products derived from these foods. The introduction of EU legislation covering health claims may help consumers identify foods with proven health benefits. Several misconceptions exist among the public with regard to cereals and cereal products. Firstly, many more people believe they have a food intolerance or allergy to these foods than evidence would suggest and, secondly, cereals are seen by some as 'fattening'. The public should not be encouraged to cut out whole food groups unnecessarily and, as cereals and cereal products provide a range of macro- and micronutrients and fibre, eliminating these foods without appropriate support and advice from a registered dietitian or other health professional could lead to problems in the long term. In the future it is possible that white flour in the UK may be fortified with folic acid (the synthetic form of the B vitamin folate) to decrease the incidence of neural tube defects during pregnancy. Such a move could also be of benefit for heart health, as poor folate status is associated with high homocysteine levels, an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, high intakes of folic acid can mask vitamin B12 deficiency, a condition that occurs more frequently with age and has serious neurological symptoms affecting the peripheral nervous system. Manipulating the expression of native genes can increase the disease resistance of cereal crops. Novel genes may also be used for this purpose, as well as for developing cereals with resistance to herbicides, and cereals with improved nutritional properties (e.g. increased levels of iron in cereals and of beta-carotene in rice). The long-term consequences and consumer acceptability of such advances must be considered and consumer choice maintained. There is a continual growth in the knowledge of the interactions between human genes and nutrients, and in the future it may be possible to target specific nutrition messages to people with specific genetic profiles. © 2004 British Nutrition Foundation Nutrition Bulletin.},

abstract={It is first discussed to what extent salt intake/metabolism may have been modulated since Homo sapiens' global spread from tropical Africa started some 200,000 years ago (10-15,000 generations). The effects on blood pressure, volume, heart rate etc. have been studied along with nearly 100-fold changes in salt intake. Disturbances and risks show up in both extreme ends of this intake range, as counterregulatory mechanisms are overswayed, but within a wide (15-20-fold) range mean pressure is usually changed only marginally, both in healthy man and in rats. When the biological setpoint for intake (salt appetite) has been tested in animals it corresponds - when adjusted to man's 65-70 kg bodyweight and metabolic rate - in sheep to 8-9 g/day and in rats to some 15 g, and it is moderately raised by mental stress. Therefore, human intakes around 10 g daily may, after all, reflect our biologically determined setpoint - rather than expressing a hedonistic abuse. When at different salt intakes not only blood pressure but also heart rate (unfortunately often neglected) are recorded, the percentage increase in pressure at high intakes is mostly less than the percentage decrease in heart rate - and vice versa at low intakes. Thus, as the long-term load on left heart and arteries can be approximated to the product of pressure and rate, low intakes often imply increases of long-term load - to which comes that the for the left ventricular coronary supply so important diastolic phase is shortened. Almost throughout such aspects have been overlooked at the - at best - modest reductions of pressure that have been reported at tolerable reductions of salt intake. The same is true concerning results showing how pressure is reduced considerably more by e.g. three weekly hours of physical activity which, in addition, has uniquely beneficial influences on metabolism, immune defences, sympatho-hormonal activity, etc. Towards such a background suggestions concerning overall reductions of salt intake are hardly justified, particularly as the induction of primary (essential) hypertension appears to be far more dependent on present-day psychosocial influences by means of central enhancements of neuro-endocrine activities. - It is a different matter that salt contents in processed foods should be declared, and kept low - first, because »salt sensitivity« is not uncommon, second, salt is then easy to add but impossible to eliminate.},

abstract={Background: Cardiovascular disease accounts for much morbidity and mortality in developed countries and is becoming increasingly important in less developed regions. Systolic blood pressure above 115 mm Hg accounts for two-thirds of strokes and almost half of ischaemic heart disease cases, and cholesterol concentrations exceeding 3·8 mmol/L for 18% and 55%, respectively. We report estimates of the population health effects, and costs of selected interventions to reduce the risks associated with high cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure in areas of the world with differing epidemiological profiles. Methods: Effect sizes were derived from systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and the effect on health outcomes projected over time for populations with differing age, sex, and epidemiological profiles. Incidence data from estimates of burden of disease were used in a four-state longitudinal population model to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted and patients treated. Costs were taken from previous publications, or estimated by local experts, in 14 regions. Findings: Non-personal health interventions, including government action to stimulate a reduction in the salt content of processed foods, are cost-effective ways to limit cardiovascular disease and could avert over 21 million DALYs per year worldwide. Combination treatment for people whose risk of a cardiovascular event over the next 10 years is above 35% is also cost effective leading to substantial additional health benefits by averting an additional 63 million DALYs per year worldwide. Interpretation: The combination of personal and non-personal health interventions evaluated here could lower the global incidence of cardiovascular events by as much as 50%.},

abstract={Objective: The main concepts involved in the therapeutic management of intracranial hypertension are revisited, including pathophysiology, monitoring, the traditional approach, and also the presentation of recently proposed therapies. Source of data: The main medical literature data bases (especially Medline and Lilacs) were searched for articles published in the last 10 years, and traditional text books and dissertations focusing the subject were consulted. Summary of the findings: Intracranial hypertension may be associated with several cerebral neurologic lesions from traumatic, infectious or metabolic origin, and in severe cases may represent an important factor for morbidity and mortality. Increases in intracranial pressure interfere with cerebral blood flow; in order to maintain an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure, it is necessary to both reduce and control intracranial hypertension and combat low blood pressure from the very beginning of treatment. Adequate monitoring is essential, and the main points addressed in conventional management include elevation of the head of bed to 30° C, central positioning of the head, optimization of hypocapnia, perfect metabolic and hydro-electrolyte balance, sedation, anti-convulsive therapy, liquor drainage, and the use of barbiturics, mannitol and furosemide. New therapies currently under investigation include the use of dexanabinol, hypertonic saline solutions, moderate hypothermia, decompressive craniectomy, optimization of cerebral perfusion pressure, and reduction in cerebral microvasculature pressure (Lund therapy). Conclusions: The use of new therapies to effectively control intracranial hypertension, especially in cases that are refractory to the usual treatment, represent a promising scenario in the management of this problem.},

abstract={The relationship between salt intake and blood pressure was once highly controversial. Early comparisons of populations did support the salt hypothesis but were difficult to interpret because of unmeasured confounding variables. However, the INTERSALT project, published in 1988 overcame many of these problems and reported within - and between - population gradients of sodium excretion and blood pressure or the rise in blood pressure with advancing age. Of the five long-term follow-up studies of salt intake and cardiovascular disease, two suggested that a low salt intake might be harmful. These studies are however open to much criticism. The three other studies reported positive relationships between salt intake and stroke or heart attack. Whilst there is little doubt that salt restriction lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients, there remains some uncertainty whether any effect is seen in normotensives. The effects, if present, are small (reducing systolic pressure by about 2 mmHg) and not clinically useful, although if applied on a population-wide basis they might reduce the prevalence of hypertension by about 17%. In many countries food producers and food standards agencies are beginning to respond by cutting the salt content of processed foods.},

abstract={Background: Hypertension is an important problem in sub-Saharan Africa. The low use of processed food in this area makes a population approach to reducing salt intake feasible. Aim: To create an age-sex register for 12 villages in Ghana as the first stage of a community study of the effect of dietary salt reduction on blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion in West African villagers. Design: Household survey and population census. Methods: Over three months, village maps were sketched and a complete list of total number of households, adults (with age and gender) and children in each village was obtained. Results: The six semi-urban villages were larger than the six rural villages (10 368 vs. 6597 inhabitants) and almost half the total population was under 16. Conclusions: Accurate census data are important in the design, implementation and interpretation of community studies and intervention trials. We outline the methods by which census data can be collected in rural and semi-urban sub-Saharan African villages, and emphasize the importance of painstaking, thorough work in the collection of such data.},

abstract={Cereal grains and their products provide around 30% of total energy intake in British adults, (much more than any of the other major food groups). Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the largest single cause of death in Britain and many other Western countries. This review examines the question whether there is a relation between cereal consumption and CHD. Several of the nutrients in cereals have known potential for reducing risk factors for CHD: the linoleic acid, fibre, vitamin E, selenium and folate. Cereals also contain phytoestrogens of the lignan family and several phenolic acids with antioxidant properties. Processing generally reduces the content of these nutrients and bioprotective substances. Although cereals at the farm gate are very low in salt, processed cereal foods, eg bread and some breakfast cereals, are high-salt foods and thus could contribute to raising blood pressure. Human experiments have clearly shown that oat fibre tends to lower plasma total and LDL cholesterol but wheat fibre does not. Rice bran and barley may also lower cholesterol but most people do not eat enough barley to have an effect. Cereal foods with low glycaemic index such as pasta and oats are beneficial for people with diabetes and might lower plasma lipids. Between 1996 and 2001 an accumulation of five very large cohort studies in the USA, Finland and Norway have all reported that subjects consuming relatively large amounts of whole grain cereals have significantly lower rates of CHD. This confirms an earlier report from a small British cohort. The protective effect does not seem to be due to cholesterol-lowering. While cohort studies have shown this consistent protective effect of whole grain cereals, there has been (only one) randomised controlled secondary prevention trial of advice to eat more cereal fibre. In this there was no reduction of the rate of reinfarction. The trial had some weaknesses, eg there were eight different diets, compliance was not checked objectively, and duration was for only 2 y. It appears valid to make health claims (as now permitted by the US FDA) that whole grain cereal foods and oat meal or bran may reduce the risk of CHD.},

abstract={Objective: To determine the effects of magnesium sulfate therapy on maternal and fetal osmolality in pre-eclampsia. Methods: A total of 34 pre-eclamptic women and 22 normal pregnant women participated in the study. Venous blood was drawn upon admission to the labor and delivery unit. Pre-eclamptic patients received standard magnesium sulfate therapy and had a second sample of venous blood drawn 4 h following the beginning of therapy. Fetal umbilical vein blood was obtained immediately following delivery in both groups. Osmolality was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer. Electrolyte levels were measured with a NOVA 8 biomedical analyzer. Data were analyzed via Student's t test, linear regression and correlation with significance established at p < 0.05. Results: We found no significant difference between the maternal osmolalities of the control and pre-eclamptic groups. Interestingly, fetal cord blood osmolality was significantly lower than maternal osmolality in the normal pregnant women. Sodium levels were also lower, while potassium and ionized calcium levels were higher in the fetal blood. In women with pre-eclampsia treated with magnesium sulfate, there was no difference between the osmolality of the maternal and fetal blood, while potassium and ionized calcium levels were still higher in the fetal blood. Finally, we found no correlation between maternal osmolality and blood pressure. Conclusions: High blood pressure in pre-eclampsia is not associated with altered osmolality. An absence of the normal decrease in fetal osmolality is observed in pre-eclamptic women treated with magnesium sulfate.},

abstract={More than 20% of adults in industrialized countries display arterial pressure outside the normal physiological range. For most individuals, the molecular basis of hypertension remains unknown. In some hypertensive persons, a postprandial natriuretic response, normally elicited by a salty meal, is diminished and contributes to body sodium accumulation and plasma volume expansion. An important physiological mechanism ensuring the increased salt excretion following ingestion of salt is based on a luminocrine and endocrine secretion of novel small intestinal peptides--guanylins. Membrane guanylate cyclase receptors mediate effects of these peptides that provide a novel link between the intestine and kidney by means of circulating molecular guanylin forms. It can be expected that the emergence of the novel guanylin signaling pathways will energize search for molecular defects causing hypertension.},

abstract={The height of the blood pressure is one of the most impotant determinants of strokes and heart attacks, the two most common causes of death and disability in the western world. In undeveloped communities that do not have access to salt, blood pressure remains low throughout life in comparison with that in developed countries, where blood pressure is higher and increases inexorably with increasing age. An understanding of why blood pressure increases could lead to better preventive strategies, and thereby to a major reduction in cardiovascular disease. Much evidence suggests that salt intake plays an important role in elevating blood pressure. At the same time, elegant cross-transplantation experiments on inherited hypertension in rats and more circumstantial evidence in humans suggests that an inherited abnormality in the kidney, combined with our high salt intake, is likely to explain the development of high blood pressure in individuals. At the same time, studies now show that modest reductions in salt intake cause large decreases in blood pressure in hypertensive individuals and smaller, but very important from a public health perspective, decreases in blood pressure in normotensive people. A large effort is now required to persuade the salt, soft drink, and food manufacturers to reduce the unnecessarily high salt content of processed food. © 2001 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

This paper briefly reviews the impetus for including sodium guidelines, changes in them over time and factors influencing these changes. Although guidance appears to have changed little over the five editions, differences in wording reflect changes in knowledge of the link between sodium and blood pressure, a shift in public health policy toward prevention and increased consumption of processed and prepared foods. We examine methods to monitor sodium intake and assess whether Americans are following these guidelines. Available data indicate that American adolescents and adults are consuming more sodium than recommended and are unable to judge whether the amount of sodium in their diet is appropriate. Although Americans avoid adding salt to food at the table, their efforts may have little effect given that the majority of salt consumed is added during commercial processing and preparation. Thus, changes to the Dietary Guidelines that emphasize the major sources of sodium in U.S. diets and advice to "choose and prepare foods with less salt" may help all Americans meet recommended sodium intake levels in the future.},

The results included 213 hypertension patients and 311 adults who resided in Taipei county. There were significant differences between these two groups in age, economic status and education level. A body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) of more than 26.4 was observed in 32% of the hypertension patients and 22% of the adults. About 25% of the subjects smoked and drank. Sixty percent of the subjects exercised. Eighty-three percent patients and 54% healthy people regularly measured their blood pressure. The average score for correct answers for all subjects was 7.5 out of 10. The preventive knowledge score and therapeutic knowledge score were no different for both groups. However, hypertensive patients had a less obedient attitude than healthy people. These patients had a higher score for "avoiding fatty foods" and "disliking salt-processed foods" than the general public. About fifty percent of the patients and general public did not know information- related to hypertension.

abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to evaluate professionals working at a University Hospital as to their knowledge and attitudes towards stroke. METHODS: Individuals working in the hospital were divided in two groups, Health care workers (HCW) and non-Health care workers (NHCW), and further subdivided according to level of schooling, resulting in seven strata. A closed questionnaire addressing epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, typical symptoms, treatment, clinical course and personal attitudes towards smoking and blood pressure control, was applied to a random sample of each stratum (total n = 309). The physicians group included 48 individuals. Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons of non-parametric data was used. Special attention was given to the wrong answers. RESULTS: Physicians correctly answered 92.6% of the questions. Their performance was superior to that of all other groups in all subgroups of questions. However, a large number of errors was found in questions addressing mortality and hospital mortality following stroke and the intimate relation between coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis. Treatment options in cerebral infarction are also poorly recognised. CONCLUSIONS: Although physicians general knowledge about stroke is good, they frequently do not perceive it as a critical disease requiring urgent hospital evaluation and care. The importance of a thorough cardiac evaluation following stroke and of the intimate relation between cardiac and cerebral ischemic disease is also unclear to this group. More hours of stroke teaching and practical training in stroke could possibly fill these gaps.},

abstract={Community intervention projects, efforts at single centers, and multicenter, prospective, dietary salt-restriction trials suggest that such an intervention is neither easy to achieve nor simple to maintain. Community- wide interventions based on advertisements, pamphlets, posters, radio messages, instructions in schools or other institutions, and cooperation from food suppliers such as butchers and bakers resulted in a slight decrease in salt consumption, mostly in normotensive women. A demonstration project at a single center showed that lowering salt intake long-term by 50%, in hypertensive patients was feasible. That study included self-administered, positive-feedback devices to indicate adherence and a role for a household partner in achieving compliance. Multicenter intervention trials also indicate that reducing salt intake in the long term is feasible. However, in all intervention trials the subjects were highly selected, stable, generally married male volunteers. An elaborate training program involving many health care professionals was necessary and recidivism was common. Successful intervention requires specific goals and delegated responsibilities on the part of the health care team, careful assessment of the patient and the risk factors, as well as motivation for behavioral change, a specific plan for implementation, repetitive educational efforts, and a built-in monitoring mechanism.},

abstract={Magnesium ions (Mg2+) are pivotal in the transfer, storage and utilization of energy; Mg2+ regulates and catalyzes some 300-odd enzyme systems in mammals. The intracellular level of free Mg2+ ([Mg2+](i)) regulates intermediary metabolism, DNA and RNA synthesis and structure, cell growth, reproduction, and membrane structure. Mg2+ has numerous physiological roles among which are control of neuronal activity, cardiac excitability, neuromuscular transmission, muscular contraction, vasomotor tone, blood pressure and peripheral blood flow. Mg2+ modulates and controls cell Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticular membranes. Since the turn of this century, there has been a steady and progressive decline of dietary Mg intake to where much of the Western World population is ingesting less than an optimum RDA. Geographic regions low in soil and water Mg demonstrate increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Dietary deficiency of Mg2+ results in loss of cellular K+ and gain of cellular Na+ and calcium ions (Ca2+). Blood normally contains Mg2+ bound to proteins, Mg2+ complexed to small anion ligands and free ionized Mg2+ (IMg2+). Most clinical laboratories only now assess the total Mg, which consists of all three Mg fractions. Estimation of the IMg2+ level in serum or plasma by analysis of ultrafiltrates (complexed Mg + IMg2+) is somewhat unsatisfactory, as the methods employed do not distinguish the truly ionized form from Mg2+ bound to organic and inorganic anions. Because the levels of these ligands can vary significantly in numerous pathological states, it is desirable to directly measure the levels of IMg2+ in complex matrices such as whole blood, plasma and serum. Using novel ion selective electrodes (ISE's), we have found that there is virtually no difference in IMg2+, irrespective of whether one samples whole blood, plasma or serum. These data demonstrate that the mean concentration of IMg2+ in blood is about 600 μmoles/litre (0.54-0.65 mmol/L, 95% CI); 65-72% of total Mg being free or biologically-active Mg2+. Use of the NOVA and KONE ISE's for IMg2+ plasma and sera from patients with a variety of pathophysiologic and disease syndromes (e.g., long-term renal transplants, liver transplants, during and before cardiac surgery, ischemic heart disease [IHD], headaches, pregnancy, neonatal period, non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM), end-stage renal disease [ESRD], hemodialyse [HEM], and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), hypertension, myocardial infarction [AMI] and after excessive dietary intake of Mg), has revealed interesting data. The results indicate that long-term renal transplant patients, headache, pregnant, NIDDM, ESRD, HEM, CAPD, AMI, hypertensive, and IHD subjects exhibit, on the average significant depression in IMg2+ but not TMg. Use of 31P-NMR spectroscopy on red blood cells, from several of these disease states, to assess free intracellular Mg ([IMg2+](i)) demonstrates a high correlation (r = 0.5-0.8) between IMg2+ and [Mg2+](i). Increased dietary load of Mg, for only 6 days, in human volunteers, resulted in significant elevations in serum IMg2+ but not TMg. Correlations between the clinical course of several of the above disease syndromes and the fall in IMg2+ and [Mg2+](i) were found. The ICa2+/IMg2+ ratio appears, from our data, to be an important guide for signs of peripheral vasoconstriction, ischemia or spasm and possibly atherogenesis. Overall, our data point to important uses for ISE's for IMg2+ in the diagnosis and treatment of disease states.},

abstract={The importance of sodium balance avoiding intradialytic cardiovascular instability and interdialytic hypertension and pulmonary edema is well known. An early analytical single-pool kinetic model created to evaluate sodium balance in hemodialysis, using flame photometry to determine plasma and dialysate sodium concentrations, has been shown to have a level of imprecision of ± 2.8 mEq/l in predicting end-dialysis sodium plasma water concentrations (Napwt). The ionometric determination of sodium concentrations seems to be more accurate and refers to the activity of the sodium capable of crossing dialysis membranes. On the basis of the theoretical premises of the model mentioned above, we developed a computerized single-pool kinetic model which makes it possible to calculate the ionized dialysate sodium activity (Naol) required to reach a pre-established target of end-dialysis blood sodium activity (NaBI). Thirty-seven non-diabetic and anuric patients undergoing regular thrice-weekly hemodialysis were given their usual dialysis treatment, with NaDI at the usual value for each patient (range 137-147 mEq/l) and kept constant throughout dialysis. At the beginning and end of the session, NaDI and NaBI were measured in quadruplicate by means of a Nova-1 device (Direct Potentiometry, Pabisch Instruments). The validity of this kinetic model was tested by considering the difference between predicted and observed (P-O) NaBI at the end of dialysis [(t)]. P-O NaBI(t) was -0.37 ± 0.42 mEq/l, which was statistically different from 0 (p &lt; 0.001). When P-O NaBI(t) was plotted against ONaBI(t), it was more negative at the higher values of ONaBI(t). P-O intradialytic sodium removal (NaR) was -12.5 ± 17.8 mEq/session, which was also statistically different from 0 (p &lt; 0.001). The imprecision of this kinetic model was less than 0.84 mEq/l, as estimated by doubling the SD of P-O NaBI(t) (0.42 -2 = 0.84 mEq/1). Although the reasons for its inaccuracy especially at higher ONaBI(t) values remain to be clarified, these data are the expression of a satisfactory clinical model. © 1996 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Sodium intakes derived from processed foods, soy sauce and monosodium glutamate were 17%, 16% and 6% respectively in the urban diet, and 4%, 16%, 2% respectively in the rural diet. The mean intake of potassium was 1.95 g in the urban and 1.83 g in the rural diet. Cereals and vegetables were the major sources of dietary potassium. The intakes of total sodium, salt and soy sauce decreased as educational level increased. Similar results were found in white-collar workers and blue-collar workers or farmers. Nevertheless, an inverse association between blood pressure and education was found. The results suggest that reduction in sodium intake, especially cooking salt, and increased potassium intake are needed for nutritional control of hypertension in population-based interventions aimed at all social classes.},

abstract={The relation between dietary intake of sodium chloride and blood pressure levels remains controversial. The critical questions concern whether there is a susceptible subgroup at risk of elevated blood pressure because of sodium chloride consumption. If there is such a subgroup, what is its size and how can it be identified? Further clinical trials are needed to determine the long-term effects of sodium chloride reduction on blood pressure. The risk of disease, including stroke and coronary heart disease, is linear with blood pressure levels. A small change in blood pressure can have a relatively large impact on disease, even within the normal range of blood pressure. © 1991 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract={This article addresses general and specific aspects of dietary sodium interventions from the perspective of behavioral change. Changing dietary behavior requires relearning a range of habitual behaviors involved in day-to-day eating situations in the context of a diverse and complex food supply and in consideration of numerous factors, other than health concerns, that influence habitual eating patterns. Potential obstacles to dietary sodium reduction relate to the wide distribution of sodium in foods, the strong cultural values for salt, and the difficulty of assessing success in sodium reduction. A review of sodium interventions reported in the literature suggests that state-of-the-art behavioral change strategies can be effective in achieving reductions in sodium intake to around 3,000 mg/day but that this level is achieved only with highly motivated individuals and when a high level of intervention (i.e., intensive and multifaceted) is provided. Thus, in regard to sodium reduction in the general population, either the goal will have to be modest or the food supply will have to change so that substantial decreases in sodium intake can be accomplished with less intensive and less costly interventions. © 1991 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract={Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence links excessive salt consumption to hypertension; there appears to be no evidence that it is beneficial. I conclude that it should be public policy to advise and help Americans to reduce their salt intake. Because even mild hypertension increases risk, the overall problem does not appear to be amenable to treatment, although treatment for those with clinical hypertension will always be needed. There appears to be little likelihood that identification of those "at risk" will be successful, nor does it appear that we have the capacity at this time to conduct successful preventive field trials. It is difficult for the individual to modify his diet alone. The successful strategy is to modify the food supply by changing public demand. The public responds to dietary advice if acceptable and identifiable products are available. Because most of the salt is in commercially prepared foods and because their consumption will increase in the future, the major responsibility for lowering salt consumption will fall on the food manufacturers. They are beginning to respond, and there appears to be ample opportunity for them to reduce the salt content of foods markedly. Our temporary objectives, however, should be modest, because unrealistic objectives only discourage those who attempt to follow them. © 1991 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract={Nutritional-nonpharmacological approaches for the treatment and prevention of hypertension are of great interest Sodium reduction is one of the primary methods recommended for these purposes. The general public is interested in the redaction of dietary sodium intake and has responded with a decrease in table salt use, the purchase of lowered sodium food products, and the use of food labels to help guide food purchases. Countervailing trends in the use of convenience foods and dining out increase the difficulty for individuals to lower sodium intake. Clinical trials that have used sodium reduction alone or in combination with other lifestyle therapies have demonstrated the feasibility of reducing dietary sodium intake from 30% to 50% for up to 4 years, in a variety of populations. Trials that used lifestyle and weight loss interventions have also achieved significant reductions in body weight and alcohol consumption and increases in physical activity. A variety of studies indicate that long-term sodium reduction is feasible and that it is acceptable to patients. No negative consequences of these interventions have been observed, and in some cases improvement in the intake of other nutrients has occurred. Nonphannacological interventions have resulted in hypertension control in significant proportions of the trial populations. These studies demonstrate that the foregoing types of interventions can significantly contribute to hypertension treatment and prevention. © 1991 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract={Objective - To determine whether the reduction in blood pressure achieved in trials of dietary salt reduction is quantitatively consistent with estimates derived from blood pressure and sodium intake in different populations, and, if so, to estimate the impact of reducing dietary salt on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease. Design - Analysis of the results of 68 crossover trials and 10 randomised controlled trials of dietary salt reduction. Main outcome measure - Comparison of observed reductions in systolic blood pressure for each trial with predicted values calculated from between population analysis. Results - In the 45 trials in which salt reduction lasted four weeks or less the observed reductions in blood pressure were less than those predicted, with the difference between observed and predicted reductions being greatest in the trials of shortest duration. In the 33 trials lasting five weeks or longer the predicted reductions in individual trials closely matched a wide range of observed reductions. This applied for all age groups and for people with both high and normal levels of blood pressure. In people aged 50-59 years a reduction in daily sodium intake of 50 mmol (about 3 g of salt), attainable by moderate dietary salt reduction would, after a few weeks, lower systolic blood pressure by an average of 5 mm Hg, and by 7 mm Hg in those with high blood pressure (170 mm Hg); diastolic blood pressure would be lowered by about half as much. It is estimated that such a reduction in salt intake by a whole Western population would reduce the incidence of stroke by 26% and of ischaemic heart disease by 15%. Conclusions - The results from the trials support the estimates from the observational data in the accompanying two papers. The effect of universal moderate dietary salt reduction on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease would be substantial - larger, indeed, than could be achieved by fully implementing recommended policy for treating high blood pressure with drugs. However, reduction also in the amount of salt added to processed foods would lower blood pressure by at least twice as much and prevent some 70000 deaths a year in Britain as well as much disability.},

Group 1 was made up of the 25 subjects whose levels of plasma renin activity were the lowest (1.93 ± 0.70 ng/ml/hr). Group 2 comprised the 26 subjects with the highest plasma renin activity levels (4.80 ± 0.84 ng/ml/hr). The following parameters were measured on all subjects: plasma renin activity and plasma and urinary aldosterone levels (by radioimmunoassay), serum ionic calcium levels (by Nova-2), total serum calcium, and serum and urinary magnesium values (by atomic absorption), serum and urinary sodium and potassium levels (by flame photometry), and creatinine clearance. In the group with low plasma renin activity (group 1), our findings included low serum ionic calcium levels (P < .001); high coefficients of plasma aldosterone/plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone/plasma renin activity (P < .001); a significant correlation between the serum ionic calcium level and plasma renin activity (P < .001); and an inverse correlation between systolic arterial tension and the serum ionic calcium level (P < .05). These changes were more similar to changes described in hypotensive patients with low plasma renin activity than to the findings in group 2 subjects. We speculate that normotensive subjects with low plasma renin activity present significant changes in the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sodium and calcium levels, and that this group is at risk for hypertension. A diet low in sodium and high in calcium could be an effective preventive measure.},

Thirty-one schools with 1,839 students were included. Measurements were made at the beginning and end of the school year. Participation rates exceeded 90% for school-based programs and 80% for those at home. Knowledge about salt increased significantly, with the classroom program showing the largest gains. However, reported salting behavior and sodium measured by 24-hr recall and overnight urines failed to show consistent and significant differences between treatments. Further analysis suggested that most ingested salt was hidden in processed foods with only a small fraction added in cooking or at meals (less than 7%). If sodium intake is to be reduced significantly in healthy children, more attention must be paid to hidden sources, particularly processed foods.},

Blacks are affected more than whites and women more than men. In many nonindustrial populations, hypertension is not inevitably associated with aging. Environmental factors that may be the cause of increasing blood pressure seen with aging in the West include obesity, stress, less dietary consumption of calcium and potassium, and greater salt consumption, along with the use of processed food that is high in salt. Taste sensation decreases in the elderly, with less sensitivity to salt resulting. Defining the level of blood pressure considered to be hypertensive in the elderly has been controversial.

abstract={A substantial prevalence of clinical hypertension with a large portion of the adult population requiring daily antihypertensive medication makes this disease an important public health problem. The known and unknown side effects of life-long pharmacologic therapy directs searches for methods of prevention. Because the origins of high blood pressure are found in children, at a point in life where health habits are established, preventive programs directed to youth seem particularly relevant. Increased sodium intake is the most widespread nutritional factor related to the development of high blood pressure. The prevalence of hypertension and the ubiquitous nature of sodium in many processed foods, well in excess of that needed for life seem to indicate the need for a broad public health approach.

A much more sensible approach is to reduce the intake of high sodium, low potassium processed foods and increase the intake of low sodium, high potassium natural foods. In addition, KCL should be substituted either completely or partially for NaCl in cooking and at the table.},

When this technique was applied in an epidemiological context using 12 consecutive 24-hour urine collections, we found that at least 83% of the salt ingested by a population in Cambridgeshire, England, was derived from processed food. Only a small amount of the total salt intake came from cooking or from using salt on the table. The total amount of salt eaten was not as high as was previously estimated indirectly. There was a clear sex difference in salt intake which in part related simply to the finding that salt intake correlates with body weight of an individual. This study implies that those who wish to advocate a reduction in salt intake in order to prevent hypertension must reconsider their approach. Any health education programme that is geared simply to reduce discretionary salt use in the home, will have little impact on the total amount of NaCl ingested by the population.},

The Na content of a diet without any processed foods or added salt would be approximately 400-500 mg. Food industry contributes substantial amounts of salt. A nutrition policy on Na should include regulation of the Na content in infant formulas and a decreased Na intake to reduce the risk of hypertension and possibly also gastric cancer. Iodized salt is an important source of iodine in many countries. Recommendations regarding Na intake have been given in some recommended dietary intakes and in several dietary guidelines. During the last years a few Western countries have published action programmes regarding Na and hypertension. Very few countries have standards regulating the salt content of certain products but in case any claims are made related to the Na content, this usually has to be declared. Special dietary foods with low Na content and salt substitutes are available in many countries. Standards for such products have been published by the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission.},

abstract={Hypertension (high blood pressure) is 1 of 15 health priorities of the Public Health Service set forth in the report, 'Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives for the Nation.' The nine objectives for hypertension include improved health status, reduced risk factors, increased public-professional awareness, improved services and protection, and improved surveillance-evaluation systems. A number of Federal agencies, coordinated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, are working to reach the hypertension objectives in cooperation with State, local, and voluntary agencies and organizations. A great deal of progress has been made toward the objectives, as reflected by a variety of indicators. By 1980, for example, 34.1 percent of the population with hypertension had their blood pressure controlled at less than 160/95 mm Hg, but in 1972 only 16.5 percent were so controlled. Since 1972, the age-adjusted death rate has dropped 42 percent for stroke and 27 percent for coronary heart disease. Data indicate that the national goal for sodium ingestion (3-6 grams daily) may already have been met. Fifty-one percent of the population understand that hypertension may lead to stroke, meeting another objective. Public knowledge about hypertension as a 'major likely cause of heart trouble' almost doubled in the 6-year period for which data are available. In 1982, 30 percent of processed food in grocery stores had sodium content labeling and almost 50 prcent had calorie labeling, according to studies conducted by the Bureau of Foods of the Food and Drug Administration. Efforts are underway to develop a methodology for assessing incidence of hypertension and categories of hypertension control, a need spelled out in another objective. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program, administered by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, coordinates the ongoing activities that support the objectives: they include research, demonstration, and education.},

Changes in the purchase of salt in England and Wales are compared with changes in mortality from cerebrovascular disease (1958-78). Stroke mortality, a major sequel of hypertension, has declined in this period. Consumer purchases of salt have decreased also, as suggested by the National Food Survey. While these trends are consistent with the salt-hypertension hypothesis, the picture is confused by an increase in meals eaten outside the home, by the consumption of more processed food, and by a higher prevalence of refrigerators. Other events, such as medical treatment of hyprtension or changes in the case fatality rate, could have contributed to the decline in stroke mortality. This secular trend analysis, using available data, does not clarify the salt-hypertension debate.},

Males consume more NaCl than females and intakes of both sexes decline with age. Sodium chloride ingested with grain and cereal products and meat comprise about 50% of the daily nondiscretionary NaCl intake. Additional amounts of sodium are ingested daily in drinking water and with drugs, but their contribution is difficult to determine. Total daily nondiscretionary intake of potassium is less well studied and is estimated to be in the range of 4 to 11 g/person.},

From at least 1928 until about 1940 essential hypertension was reported to be a rare disease among the population in Kenya and Uganda. Currently, it is 1 of the common causes of heart failure and a major cause of cerebrovascular disease in many hospitals in these 2 nations. Field data in these countries suggest that blood pressure rises during adult life, and essential hypertension occurs in salt-sensitive individuals, when sodium chloride daily intake is excessive. If the intake of potassium chloride is less than that of sodium chloride, and the intake of dietary fiber decreases much, as happens when diets are westernized, these may act as subsidiary risk factors. The East African diets are becoming more and more westernized. The 1st major dietary change involves the addition of much salt to low-salt unprocessed foods. With progressive westernization of diets the foods processed by manufacturers replace homegrown staples. These processed foods contain considerably more sodium, rather less potassium, and much less dietary fiber. While this multiple dietary change takes place, blood pressure levels, previously low and not rising with age, begin to rise during adult life. Essential hypertension, once rare, becomes common in sodium sensitive persons. Diets comparable in many respects to the 1930 Kikuyu diet are suggested to reverse essential hypertension. The therapeutic diet should be of low sodium chloride and should contain much unrefined high fiber high starch foods.},

abstract={This review considers the mechanism, prevention and therapy of sodium-dependent, low-renin, presumably volume-expanded, hypertension. Certain evidence suggests that in susceptible persons the basic problem is a genetic or acquired deficiency in the ability of the kidney to excrete sodium and hence water. This places them at a disadvantage in a society such as ours in which the salt intake is uniformly high, to a large extent because of the salt content in commercially processed foods. Other evidence suggests that the blood pressure level rises in part because the volume expansion evokes the release of an unknown, slowly-acting, pressor agent which operates by stimulating the contractility of cardiovascular muscle through suppression of the cellular sodium-potassium pump, much in the manner of the cardiac glycosides. Several investigators and the Select Committee on GRAS Substances suggest that the incidence of saltdependent hypertension could be significantly decreased in a society such as ours if salt intake were reduced from the present level of approximately 10 g/day to 12 g/day. An obvious starting point is a reduction of the salt content in processed foods. The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council suggests that a Judicious combination of dietary sodium restriction and the use of an appropriate diuretic is the most rational approach to the treatment and management of diseases characterized by retention of sodium. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

abstract={There is no co-ordinated food and nutrition policy in Britain, primarily because it is still not recognized that diet has an important role to play in the development of many diseases of affluence. The demand for absolute proof of the dietary component of disease on a population level ignores both the innate biological susceptibility in only a portion of the population to a particular nutrient as well as the increasing evidence from studies on non-human primates that diet plays a key role in several conditions including heart disease. Government remains unsure of how to implement its own current recommendations and the traditional paternalistic and conservative approach delays action. Vested interests, seeking only short-term gains, are not confined to industrial concerns. Marketing Boards are allowed almost unfettered freedom to promote nutritionally undesirable eating habits. Health education in schools remains inadequate with most of the involved teachers still promoting incorrect concepts. The medical profession is still unwilling to take a preventive approach to disease with the hospital physician maintaining treatment programmes for obesity, diabetes and heart disease which have only marginal effects on a public health problem. General practitioners are better able to start practising preventive medicine but they need to be helped by community physicians who should begin on their main task of implementing policies for preventing disease rather than limiting themselves to their current preoccupation with systems analyses and operational research. © 1980 The Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.},
