  abstract = {A diet rich in potassium is important to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study assessed potassium intake; food sources of potassium (including NOVA level of processing, purchase origin of these foods); and sodium-to-potassium ratio (Na:K) in a cross-section of Australian adults. Data collection included 24-h urines (n = 338) and a 24-h diet recall (subsample n = 142). The mean (SD) age of participants was 41.2 (13.9) years and 56\% were females. Mean potassium (95\%CI) 24-h urinary excretion was 76.8 (73.0-80.5) mmol/day compared to 92.9 (86.6-99.1) by 24-h diet recall. Na:K was 1.9 (1.8-2.0) from the urine excretion and 1.4 (1.2-1.7) from diet recall. Foods contributing most to potassium were potatoes (8\%), dairy milk (6\%), dishes where cereal is the main ingredient (6\%) and coffee/coffee substitutes (5\%). Over half of potassium (56\%) came from minimally processed foods, with 22\% from processed and 22\% from ultraprocessed foods. Almost two-thirds of potassium consumed was from foods purchased from food stores (58\%), then food service sector (15\%), and fresh food markets (13\%). Overall, potassium levels were lower than recommended to reduce chronic disease risk. Multifaceted efforts are required for population-wide intervention aimed at increasing fruit, vegetable, and other key sources of potassium intake; reducing consumption of processed foods; and working in supermarket/food service sector settings to improve the healthiness of foods available.},

  abstract = {In Victoria, Australia, a statewide salt reduction partnership was launched in 2015. The aim was to measure Na intake, food sources of Na (level of processing, purchase origin) and discretionary salt use in a cross-section of Victorian adults prior to a salt reduction initiative. In 2016/2017, participants completed a 24-h urine collection (n 338) and a subsample completed a 24-h dietary recall (n 142). Participants were aged 41 center dot 2 (sd 13 center dot 9) years, and 56 \% were females. Mean 24-h urinary excretion was 138 (95 \% CI 127, 149) mmol/d for Na. Salt equivalent was 8 center dot 1 (95 \% CI 7 center dot 4, 8 center dot 7) g/d, equating to about 8 center dot 9 (95 \% CI 8 center dot 1, 9 center dot 6) g/d after 10 \% adjustment for non-urinary losses. Mean 24-h intake estimated by diet recall was 118 (95 \% CI 103, 133) mmol/d for Na (salt 6 center dot 9 (95 \% CI 6 center dot 0, 7 center dot 8 g/d)). Leading dietary sources of Na were cereal-based mixed dishes (12 \%), English muffins, flat/savoury/sweet breads (9 \%), regular breads/rolls (9 \%), gravies and savoury sauces (7 \%) and processed meats (7 \%). Over one-third (38 \%) of Na consumed was derived from discretionary foods. Half of all Na consumed came from ultra-processed foods. Dietary Na derived from foods was obtained from retail stores (51 \%), restaurants and fast-food/takeaway outlets (28 \%) and fresh food markets (9 \%). One-third (32 \%) of participants reported adding salt at the table and 61 \% added salt whilst cooking. This study revealed that salt intake was above recommended levels with diverse sources of intake. Results from this study suggest a multi-faceted salt reduction strategy focusing on the retail sector, and food reformulation would most likely benefit Victorians and has been used to inform the ongoing statewide salt reduction initiative.},

  abstract = {Reducing salt intake is a cost-effective public health intervention to reduce the global burden of non-communicable disease (NCDs). Ultra-processed foods contribute similar to 80\% of dietary salt in high income countries, and are becoming prominent in low-middle income countries. Instant noodle consumption is particularly high in the Asia Pacific region. The aim of this study was to compare the sodium content of instant noodles sold worldwide to identify potential for reformulation. Analysis was undertaken for 765 instant noodle products from 10 countries using packaged food composition databases of ultra-processed foods compiled by the Global Food Monitoring Group (GFMG) and national shop survey data. Sodium levels were high and variable, within and between countries. Instant noodles in China had the highest mean sodium content (1944 mg/100 g; range: 397-3678/100 g) compared to New Zealand (798 mg/100 g; range: 249-2380 mg/100 g). Average pack size ranged from 57 g (Costa Rica) to 98 g (China). The average packet contributed 35\% to 95\% of the World Health Organization recommended daily salt intake of ¡ 5 g. Forty-one percent of products met the Pacific Island (PICs) regional sodium targets, 37\% met the South Africa 2016 targets, and 62\% met the UK 2017 targets. This study emphasises a need for stronger regulation and closer monitoring to drive rigorous reformulation of salt in ultra-processed foods.},

  abstract = {Chronic non-communicable diseases correspond to the main cause of death in the world and have inadequate nutrition as one of its main modifiable risk factors, highlighting the excessive consumption of sodium and its association with cardiovascular diseases, mediated by blood pressure. This study evaluated the impact of different policy scenarios for reducing sodium consumption from processed and ultra-processed foods in the prevention of deaths due to cardiovascular outcomes in the adult population in Brazil. We used secondary data from public reports and databases of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) and population surveys. We analyzed the impacts, up to 2027 of three scenarios: maintenance of the current voluntary targets, and two mandatory scenarios, considering the lowest targets in the Americas and the lowest global targets. The Preventable Risk Integrated ModE1 (PRIME) analyzed the deaths prevented or delayed from sodium consumption in such scenarios. In 2027 more than 72,000 deaths would be attributed to excess sodium; the voluntary goals would result in the prevention or postponement of up to 4,001 (95\% uncertainty intervals - 95\%UI: 1,611-6,563) deaths, while the mandatory scenarios would result in the prevention of 9,704 (95\%UI: 3,955-15,665) and 15,561 (95\%UI 6,350-25,096) deaths from cardiovascular diseases, considering the lower regional and international targets, respectively. The findings suggest that the maintenance of voluntary targets has limited impact when compared to possible and more restrictive scenarios of reducing sodium content in processed and ultra-processed foods and reinforce the need to adopt measures with greater effectiveness in the country.},

  abstract = {Sodium chloride is one of the most widely used additives in the food processing sector. Currently, the daily sodium intake is approximately three times the recommended daily allowance for an adult (in Ireland and UK) and processed meat products contribute to about 20\% of the total sodium dietary intake. The dietary concern about salt consumption has encouraged food industries to consider methods for lowering salt use. However, due to the essential functions (flavour, texture and shelf-life) provided by salt in meat products, the effects of using reduced amounts of salt must be carefully considered. In this review the numerous approaches for sodium reduction in processed foods are presented, highlighting: the reduction of salt level over time, the use of salt substitutes such as other metallic salts and the use of flavour enhancers such as monosodium glutamate or yeast extract. Novel technologies to assist the development of low sodium products, such as high pressure processing and power ultrasound are also introduced. Limitations for each method are discussed, with emphasis on the microbiological implications for the shelf-life stability of low-sodium products. Multiple challenges need to be addressed in order to improve the flavour perception and safety of sodium-reduced products. A combination of multiple tools could give the desired effect; in particular, novel technological treatments such as high hydrostatic pressure and ultrasound technology, seem to be promising to ensure microbiological safety in low-sodium meat products. •Lower salt concentration in processed meat products may impact quality parameters and shelf-life of the products.•Response to salt reduction is product-specific. Major constraints are given by consumer acceptance.•Lactates can effectively control bacterial growth but have negative consequences on flavour and texture of the products.•New processing technology can enhance salt uptake while ensuring microbiological safety.},

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to determine whether household consumer panel food-purchasing data could be used to assess the sodium content of processed foods. Our further objectives were to estimate the mean sodium content of UK foods by category and undertake analyses weighted by food-purchasing volumes. DESIGN: Data were obtained for 21,108 British households between October 2008 and September 2009. Purchasing data (product description, product weight, annual purchases) and sodium values (mg/100 g) were collated for all food categories known to be major contributors to sodium intake. Unweighted and weighted mean sodium values were calculated. RESULTS: Data were available for 44,372 food products. The largest contributors to sodium purchases were table salt (23\%), processed meat (18\%), bread and bakery products (13\%), dairy products (12\%), and sauces and spreads (11\%). More than one-third of sodium purchased (37\%) was accounted for by 5 food categories: bacon, bread, milk, cheese, and sauces. For some food groups (bread and bakery, cereals and cereal products, processed meat), purchase-weighted means were 18-35\% higher than unweighted means, suggesting that market leaders have higher sodium contents than the category mean. CONCLUSION: The targeting of sodium reduction in a small number of food categories and focusing on products sold in the highest volumes could lead to large decreases in sodium available for consumption and therefore to gains in public health.},

Design Cross-sectional. Setting Menus for lunch, morning and afternoon snacks were collected from LDC centres. The level of food processing of all foods, beverages and ingredients was assessed utilizing a four-level food processing classification system: minimally processed (MP), processed culinary ingredients (PCI), processed (P) and ultra-processed (ULP). Results A total of thirty-five menus (lunch, n 35; snacks, n 70) provided to 1-5-year-old children were collected from seven LDC centres. Proportions of foodstuffs classified as MP, PCI, P and ULP were 54, 10, 15 and 21 \%, respectively. All lunches were classified as MP. ULP foods accounted for 6 \% of morning snacks; 41 \% of afternoon snacks. Mean daily amount of Na provided per child across all centres was 633 (sd 151) mg. ULP foods provided 40 \% of Na, followed by P (35 \%), MP (23 \%) and PCI (2 \%). Conclusions Centres provided foods resulting in a mean total daily Na content that represented 63 \% of the recommended Upper Level of Intake for Na in this age group. A significant proportion of ULP snack foods were included, which were the major contributor to total daily Na intake. Replacement of ULP snack foods with MP lower-Na alternatives is recommended.},

Design Population-based cross-sectional survey. Setting Salt intake was assessed by biochemical (24 h urinary Na excretion) and self-report methods (sodium FFQ, 24 h dietary recall, seasoned-salt questionnaire, discretionary-salt questionnaire and total reported salt intake). Participants Adults and older people (n 517) aged 20-80 years, living in Artur Nogueira, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Results Mean salt intake based on 24 h urinary Na excretion and total reported salt intake was 10 center dot 5 and 11 center dot 0 g/d, respectively; both measures were significantly correlated. Discretionary salt and seasoned salt were the most important sources of salt intake (68 center dot 2 \%). Men in the study consumed more salt than women as estimated by 24 h urinary Na excretion (11 center dot 7 v. 9 center dot 6 g salt/d; P¡0 center dot 0001). Participants known to be hypertensive added more salt to their meals but consumed less salty ultra-processed foods. Waist circumference in both sexes and BMI were positively correlated with salt intake estimated by 24 h urinary Na excretion. In addition, regression analysis revealed that being a young male or having a high waist circumference was a predictor of higher salt intake. Conclusions Salt intake in this population was well above the recommended amount. The main source of salt intake came from salt added during cooking. Salt intake varied according to sex and waist circumference.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Processed foods are major contributors to population dietary salt intake. Parts of the Australian food industry have started to decrease salt in a number of products. A definitive baseline assessment of current sodium concentrations in foods is key to targeting reformulation strategies and monitoring progress. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to systematically collate data on the sodium content of Australian processed food products and compare sodium values against maximum target levels established by the UK Food Standards Agency (UK FSA). DESIGN: Categories of processed foods that contribute the majority of salt to Australian diets were identified. Food-composition data were sought for all products in these categories, and the sodium content in mg/100 g (or mg/100 mL for liquids) was recorded for each. Mean sodium values were calculated for each grouping and compared with the UK FSA benchmarks. RESULTS: Sodium data were collected for 7221 products in 10 food groups, 33 food categories, and 90 food subcategories. The food groups that were highest in sodium were sauces and spreads (1283 mg/100 g) and processed meats (846 mg/100 g). Cereal and cereal products (206 mg/100 g) and fruit and vegetables (211 mg/100 g) were the lowest in sodium. Sixty-three percent of food categories had mean sodium concentrations above the UK FSA targets, and most had wide ranges between the most and least salty product. CONCLUSIONS: Many products, particularly breads, processed meats, and sauces, have salt amounts above reasonable benchmarks. The variation in salt concentrations between comparable products suggests that reformulation is highly feasible for many foods.},
