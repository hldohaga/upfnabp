  abstract = {Hypertension (high blood pressure) is 1 of 15 health priorities of the Public Health Service set forth in the report, "Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives for the Nation." The nine objectives for hypertension include improved health status, reduced risk factors, increased public-professional awareness, improved services and protection, and improved surveillance-evaluation systems. A number of Federal agencies, coordinated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, are working to reach the hypertension objectives in cooperation with State, local, and voluntary agencies and organizations. A great deal of progress has been made toward the objectives, as reflected by a variety of indicators. By 1980, for example, 34.1 percent of the population with hypertension had their blood pressure controlled at less than 160/95 mm Hg, but in 1972 only 16.5 percent were so controlled. Since 1972, the age-adjusted death rate has dropped 42 percent for stroke and 27 percent for coronary heart disease. Data indicate that the national goal for sodium ingestion (3-6 grams daily) may already have been met. Fifty-one percent of the population understand that hypertension may lead to stroke, meeting another objective. Public knowledge about hypertension as a "major likely cause of heart trouble" almost doubled in the 6-year period for which data are available. In 1982, 30 percent of processed food in grocery stores had sodium content labeling and almost 50 percent had calorie labeling, according to studies conducted by the Bureau of Foods of the Food and Drug Administration. Efforts are underway to develop a methodology for assessing incidence of hypertension and categories of hypertension control, a need spelled out in another objective.},

Therefore, salt intake behavior, a risk factor of hypertension, in diabetic patients plays an important role in determining their cardiovascular outcome. The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge and behaviors of health risks associated with a salt intake in adults with type 2 diabetes. This cross-sectional study was conducted among the type 2 diabetic in-patients of Bangladesh Institute of Health Sciences General Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh from October to December 2016. Data were collected from 131 respondents through interview using WHO STEPS module of salt with adaptation to local context like on amount of added salt while taking meal. Information on blood pressure, body mass index and relevant co-morbidities were also collected. About half of the respondents were women (56.5\%). Mean age of the respondents was 54.3+/-14.4 years. More than six in 10 of them (62.6\%) took added salt while taking meal; and 40.5\% took processed foods with high salt. The mean amount of added salt intake among the users was 4.4+/-1.6gm per day having no significant difference between men and women. Though 47.3\% of the respondents believed that lowering salt in meal is very important and 77.9\% of them believed that excess salt or salty sauce can cause health problems. Salt intake behavior is poor in patients with type 2 diabetes even having regular contacts with doctors and other health professionals. Appropriate measures can be taken to increase awareness, change their attitude and behavior regarding salt consumption.},

  abstract = {Background: Globally, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common diseases, and the incidence is gradually increasing. Diet management could improve the elevated HbA1c levels. Aim: This review aims to examine the effects of different types of diets on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Methods: PubMed and Google scholar databases were searched. Reports published from the years 1991 to 2021 that focused on the effect of different diets on diabetes control were selected. Results: All the studies reported that the type of diet can affect insulin secretion and glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The recommended macronutrient distribution for patients with diabetes is 30\% of fat, 45-60\% of carbohydrates, and 15-35\% of protein. Consuming more or less of these macronutrients may lead to changes in glucose metabolism and may affect insulin secretion. In fact, following alow-fat diet improves glycemic control and decreases HbA1c levels. Studies reported that a low-carbohydrate diet had the greatest effect on improving glycemic control and insulin parameters. A low-calorie diet reduced fasting plasma glucose, while a very low-calorie diet resulted in a long-term decrease in HbA1c level. A healthy diet free of processed foods and sugar, and rich in nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals contributed to maintaining controlled blood sugar and lipid plasma levels. Although studies show a low-salt diet improves blood pressure, which is common inT2DM, other findings show that restricting salt intake is associated with increased sugar consumption. Conclusion:  Healthy diet with adequate intake of energy and low-fat and low-sugar foods can enhance the glycemic control and reduce T2DM complications.},

  abstract = {Studying the factors that cause diabetes and conducting clinical trials has become a priority, particularly raising awareness of the dangers of the disease and how to overcome it. Diet habits are one of the most important risks that must be understood and carefully applied to reduce the risk of diabetes. Nowadays, consuming enough home-cooked food has become a challenge, particularly with modern life performance, pushing people to use processed foods. Ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption has grown dramatically over the last few decades worldwide. This growth is accompanied by the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. UPFs represent three main health concerns: (i) they are generally high in non-nutritive compounds such as sugars, sodium, and trans fat and low in nutritional compounds such as proteins and fibers, (ii) they contain different types of additives that may cause severe health issues, and (iii) they are presented in packages made of synthetic materials that may also cause undesirable health side-effects. The association between the consumption of UPF and the risk of developing diabetes was discussed in this review. The high consumption of UPF, almost more than 10\% of the diet proportion, could increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adult individuals. In addition, UPF may slightly increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes. Further efforts are needed to confirm this association; studies such as randomized clinical trials and prospective cohorts in different populations and settings are highly recommended. Moreover, massive improvement in foods' dietary guidelines to increase the awareness of UPF and their health concerns is highly recommended.},

  abstract = {Magnesium ions (Mg2+) are pivotal in the transfer, storage and utilization of energy; Mg2+ regulates and catalyzes some 300-odd enzyme systems in mammals. The intracellular level of free Mg2+ ([Mg2+]i) regulates intermediary metabolism, DNA and RNA synthesis and structure, cell growth, reproduction, and membrane structure. Mg2+ has numerous physiological roles among which are control of neuronal activity, cardiac excitability, neuromuscular transmission, muscular contraction, vasomotor tone, blood pressure and peripheral blood flow. Mg2+ modulates and controls cell Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticular membranes. Since the turn of this century, there has been a steady and progressive decline of dietary Mg intake to where much of the Western World population is ingesting less than an optimum RDA. Geographic regions low in soil and water Mg demonstrate increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Dietary deficiency of Mg2+ results in loss of cellular K+ and gain of cellular Na+ and calcium ions (Ca2+). Blood normally contains Mg2+ bound to proteins, Mg2+ complexed to small anion ligands and free ionized Mg2+ (IMg2+). Most clinical laboratories only now assess the total Mg, which consists of all three Mg fractions. Estimation of the IMg2+ level in serum or plasma by analysis of ultrafiltrates (complexed Mg + IMg2+) is somewhat unsatisfactory, as the methods employed do not distinguish the truly ionized form from Mg2+ bound to organic and inorganic anions. Because the levels of these ligands can vary significantly in numerous pathological states, it is desirable to directly measure the levels of IMg2+ in complex matrices such as whole blood, plasma and serum. Using novel ion selective electrodes (ISE's), we have found that there is virtually no difference in IMg2+, irrespective of whether one samples whole blood, plasma or serum. These data demonstrate that the mean concentration of IMg2+ in blood is about 600 mumoles/litre (0.54-0.65 mmol/L, 95\% Cl); 65-72\% of total Mg being free or biologically-active Mg2+. Use of the NOVA and KONE ISE's for IMg2+ on plasma and sera from patients with a variety of pathophysiologic and disease syndromes (e.g., long-term renal transplants, liver transplants, during and before cardiac surgery, ischemic heart disease [IHD], headaches, pregnancy, neonatal period, non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM), end-stage renal disease [ESRD], hemodialyse [HEM], and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), hypertension, myocardial infarction [AMI] and after excessive dietary intake of Mg), has revealed interesting data. The results indicate that long-term renal transplant patients, headache, pregnant, NIDDM, ESRD, HEM, CAPD, AMI, hypertensive, and IHD subjects exhibit, on the average significant depression in IMg2+ but not TMg. Use of 31P-NMR spectroscopy on red blood cells, from several of these disease states, to assess free intracellular Mg ([Mg2+]i demonstrates a high correlation (r = 0.5-0.8) between IMg2+ and [Mg2+]i. Increased dietary load of Mg, for only 6 days, in human volunteers, resulted in significant elevations in serum IMg2+ but not TMg. Correlations between the clinical course of several of the above disease syndromes and the fall in IMg2+ and [Mg2+]i were found. The ICa2+/IMg2+ ratio appears, from our data, to be an important guide for signs of peripheral vasoconstriction, ischemia or spasm and possibly atherogenesis. Overall, our data point to important uses for ISE's for IMg2+ in the diagnosis and treatment of disease states.},

  abstract = {Public health campaigns in several countries encourage population-wide reduced sodium (salt) intake, but excessive intake remains a major problem. Excessive sodium intake is independently related to adverse blood pressure and is a key factor in the epidemic of prehypertension/hypertension. Identification of food sources of sodium in modern diets is critical to effective reduction of sodium intake worldwide. We used data from the INTERMAP Study to define major food sources of sodium in diverse East Asian and Western population samples. INTERMAP is an international, cross-sectional, epidemiologic study of 4, 680 individuals ages 40 to 59 years from Japan (four samples), People's Republic of China (three rural samples), the United Kingdom (two samples), and the United States (eight samples); four in-depth, multipass 24-hour dietary recalls/person were used to identify foods accounting for most dietary sodium intake. In the People's Republic of China sample, most (76\%) dietary sodium was from salt added in home cooking, about 50\% less in southern than northern samples. In Japan, most (63\%) dietary sodium came from soy sauce (20\%), commercially processed fish/seafood (15\%), salted soups (15\%), and preserved vegetables (13\%). Processed foods, including breads/cereals/grains, contributed heavily to sodium intake in the United Kingdom (95\%) and the United States (for methodological reasons, underestimated at 71\%). To prevent and control prehypertension/hypertension and improve health, efforts to remove excess sodium from diets in rural China should focus on reducing salt in home cooking. To avoid excess sodium intake in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, salt must be reduced in commercially processed foods. Copyright 2010 American Dietetic Association.

A closed questionnaire addressing epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, typical symptoms, treatment, clinical course and personal attitudes towards smoking and blood pressure control, was applied to a random sample of each stratum (total n = 309). The physicians group included 48 individuals. Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons of non-parametric data was used. Special attention was given to the wrong answers., RESULTS: Physicians correctly answered 92.6\% of the questions. Their performance was superior to that of all other groups in all subgroups of questions. However, a large number of errors was found in questions addressing mortality and hospital mortality following stroke and the intimate relation between coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis. Treatment options in cerebral infarction are also poorly recognised., CONCLUSIONS: Although physicians general knowledge about stroke is good, they frequently do not perceive it as a critical disease requiring urgent hospital evaluation and care. The importance of a thorough cardiac evaluation following stroke and of the intimate relation between cardiac and cerebral ischemic disease is also unclear to this group. More hours of stroke teaching and practical training in stroke could possibly fill these gaps.},

The agency is retaining the currently effective, less restrictive, "first-tier" sodium level requirements for all food categories, including individual foods (480 milligrams (mg)) and meals and main dishes (600 mg), and is dropping the "second-tier" (more restrictive) sodium level requirements for all food categories. Based on the comments received about technological barriers to reducing sodium in processed foods and poor sales of products that meet the second-tier sodium level, the agency has determined that requiring the more restrictive sodium levels would likely inhibit the development of new "healthy" food products and risk substantially eliminating existing "healthy" products from the marketplace. After reviewing the comments and evaluating the data from various sources, FDA has become convinced that retaining the higher first-tier sodium level requirements for all food products bearing the term "healthy" will encourage the manufacture of a greater number of products that are consistent with dietary guidelines for a variety of nutrients. The agency has also revised the regulatory text of the "healthy" regulation to clarify the scope and meaning of the regulation and to reformat the nutrient content requirements for "healthy" into a more readable set of tables, consistent with the Presidential Memorandum instructing that regulations be written in plain language.},

The aim of this study was to estimate the sodium intake and identify the sources of sodium in the diet of undergraduate students attending the University of Novi Sad., Methods: Students completed a questionnaire to gather data on their gender, age and university faculty attended, and then a 24 h dietary recall. The sodium intake of the students was calculated using the dietary recall data and data on the sodium content of foods. The contribution of different food groups as well as of specific foodstuffs to the total sodium intake was calculated., Results: The mean estimated sodium intake of the students was 3,938.5 +/- 1,708.1 mg/day. The sodium intake of 89.1\% of the surveyed students exceeded the guideline for sodium intake, the majority of the sodium coming from processed foods (78.9\% of the total sodium intake). The food groups that contributed the most to the total sodium intake of the students were meat and meat products (21.7\%) and cereals and cereal-based products (18.6\%). Bread and other bakery products were responsible for 13.1\% of the total sodium intake., Conclusion: High sodium intake in students of the University of Novi Sad puts them at high risk of developing high blood pressure. The food industry should work towards reformulating products with high sodium content, especially bread and other bakery products. Efforts should be taken to reduce sodium intake among undergraduate students in Novi Sad.},

  abstract = {India has experienced a rising prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors in the past 15 years: the prevalence of diabetes has increased from 5.9\% to 9.1\%, hypertension from 17.2\% to 29.2\%, and obesity from 4\% to 15\%. The increase is among all socioeconomic groups and in urban and rural populations, though the quantum of change varies. A concomitant increase in per capita consumption of sugar from 22 to 55.3 g/day and total fat from 21.2 to 54 g/day was observed, with significant differences between states of high and low human development index (HDI). Per capita consumption of sugar, salt, and fat is consistently and significantly associated with overweight and obesity but variably associated with the occurrence of hypertension and diabetes. Market research shows that approximately 50-60\% of total salt, sugar, and fat in Indian markets is procured by bulk purchasers, generally for manufacturing processed food items. This sector of the Indian economy is among the fastest growing, with several policy incentives. It is not clear from most of the data sets whether available information on per capita sugar, salt, and fat consumption has considered the contribution of processed and ready-to-eat food items. The unprecedented changes of rapid urbanization, mechanization, and globalization demand close monitoring of social, developmental, and economic determinants. This paper provides pieces of evidence to justify a whole-of-society (WoS) framework for monitoring the inputs, processes, and behavioral components of the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke (NPCDCS) in India.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among African Americans in the U.S., with high blood pressure and obesity being two of the main determinants. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet is effective in changing behaviors associated with these health concerns, but has not been adapted to community settings., METHODS: Men on the Move: Growing Communities (MOTMGC) was evaluated using a quasi-experimental cross-sectional design. Surveys were conducted with rural African Americans aged {$>$}=18 years prior to the intervention (2008) and at the end of the project (2013), with the final analysis conducted in 2015. Using a community-based participatory research approach, MOTMGC provided culturally appropriate education and changes to the environment to improve access to fruits and vegetables, low-fat, and low-sodium foods., RESULTS: Declines in prevalence of overweight and obese respondents and hypertension were seen in the intervention but not the comparison county. Participants with high levels of participation reported eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day, a greater variety of fruits and vegetables, less salt, and seasoning their vegetables with less fat more often than those who did not participate in educational activities. Participants reported that as a result of their access to MOTMGC gardens, they were more likely to eat more fruits, vegetables, and locally grown food, and less processed food and fast food., CONCLUSIONS: Adapting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet to community settings through culturally appropriate community-based efforts can improve dietary behaviors, BMI, and blood pressure.

  abstract = {The increase in the availability of processed and ultra-processed foods has altered the eating patterns of populations, and these foods constitute an exposure factor for the development of arterial hypertension. This systematic review analyzed evidence of the association between consumption of processed/ultra-processed foods and arterial hypertension in adults and older people. Electronic searches for relevant articles were performed in the PUBMED, EMBASE and LILACS databases. The review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The search of the databases led to the retrieval of 2323 articles, eight of which were included in the review. A positive association was found between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and blood pressure/arterial hypertension, whereas insufficient evidence was found for the association between the consumption of processed foods and arterial hypertension. The results reveal the high consumption of ultra-processed foods in developed and middle-income countries, warning of the health risks of such foods, which have a high energy density and are rich in salt, sugar and fat. The findings underscore the urgent need for the adoption of measures that exert a positive impact on the quality of life of populations, especially those at greater risk, such as adults and older people.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The processing of food can cause changes that turn them into risk factors for chronic diseases. A higher degree of food processing is associated with the development of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption and the prevalence of MetS and its risk factors, focusing on a population group especially subjected to precarious living conditions and food insecurity., METHOD: Cross-sectional population-based study with women (19 to 59 years) from Quilombola communities of Alagoas. The socioeconomic, demographic, anthropometric, health status, lifestyle, and food intake (24-h recall) variables were analyzed. The dependent variable was the MetS, defined using the harmonization criteria of the Joint Interim Statement, and its components. The foods consumed were categorized according to the Nova Classification, assuming the highest UPF consumption as risk exposure. The measure of association was the prevalence ratio (PR) and respective 95\%CI, calculated by Poisson regression with robust variance. We also analyzed the association with the Nova score of UPF consumption., RESULTS: We investigated 895 women (38.9 +/- 11.0 years), of whom 48.3\% had MetS. On average, 15.9\% of the total energy intake came from UPF. Lower Nova scores were associated with a lower prevalence of diabetes and low HDL. Higher UPF consumption was associated with a 30\% higher prevalence of hypertension (PR = 1.30; 95\%CI: 1.06-1.61)., CONCLUSION: The highest UPF consumption was positively associated with the prevalence of hypertension, while a lower Nova score was a protective factor against diabetes and low HDL. UPF consumption in Quilombola communities is important but lower than that observed in the Brazilian population in general. It is suggested that public health programs be implemented to promote healthy eating while valuing the existing eating habits and traditions among the remaining Brazilian Quilombola people.

The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for sodium is 2300 mg*day(-1) for adults, based on the relationship between sodium intake and increased blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure, which is prevalent among Canadians, is, in turn, a major risk factor for stroke, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease. Sodium intake is not the only determinant of blood pressure; other modifiable risk factors include relative mass, physical activity, overall dietary quality, and alcohol consumption. However, because {$>$}90\% of adult Canadian men and two thirds of Canadian women have sodium intakes above the UL, Health Canada's Working Group on Dietary Sodium Reduction has been charged with developing, implementing, and overseeing a strategy to reduce Canadians' sodium intakes. It is estimated that approximately 75\% of dietary sodium is added during food processing; in addition to taste and palatability, sodium also has functional roles in food manufacturing and preservation, although the amounts used often exceed those required. Because of the central role of processed foods in sodium intake, the strategy proposed by Health Canada's Working Group includes voluntary reduction of sodium in processed foods and foods sold in food service establishments. It will also include an education and awareness campaign, and research and surveillance. Initiatives to reduce sodium in other parts of the world have demonstrated that it will be challenging to reduce sodium intake to the recommended range and will likely require many years to accomplish.},

  abstract = {The subject of sodium toxicity has been controversial for a long time. There is no question that the element can be noxious when consumed acutely in large quantities and there is little doubt as to cause and effect Conversely the consequences of mederate chronic sodium consumption are much harder to document. The effects are insidious and are subject to modification by a variety of environmental influences such as dietary potassium. In addition most studies of chronic sodium excess have dealt with elusive subject of "essential" hypertension. Interpretations of data have been very difficult, and conflicting reports have occurred. Nevertheless epidemiological, clinical, and animal studies show that chronic excess sodium ingestion acting upon a substrate of genetic susceptibility, is an important etiologic factor in essential hypertension and the expression of its sequelae. Positive correlations have also have been obtained between dietary salt and the incidence of stroke and gastric cancer. Dietary potassium appears to confer some degree of protection from the toxic properties of sodium through some unknown mechanism. Available evidence indicates that a suitable intake of salt for man might be approximately 3.5 g/day and probably less. Salt consumption in most developed countries ranges between 8 to 40 g/day, and modern methods of food processing and preparation deplete the protective potassium. The incidences of hypertension in these countries range between 15 to 40\% of their populations, and it exacts a dreadful toll. Recognition of the toxic properties of sodium and knowledge of the mechanisms involved in its toxicity offer great possibilities in the area of preventive medicine It may be possible by the sorting out of hypertension-prone subjects and dietary intervention to prevent or minimize the development of hypertension in susceptible individuals. This says nothing of other aspects of sodium toxicity, of which we are largely ignorant.},

Early comparisons of populations did support the salt hypothesis but were difficult to interpret because of unmeasured confounding variables. However, the INTERSALT project, published in 1988 overcame many of these problems and reported within - and between - population gradients of sodium excretion and blood pressure or the rise in blood pressure with advancing age. Of the five long-term follow-up studies of salt intake and cardiovascular disease, two suggested that a low salt intake might be harmful. These studies are however open to much criticism. The three other studies reported positive relationships between salt intake and stroke or heart attack. Whilst there is little doubt that salt restriction lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients, there remains some uncertainty whether any effect is seen in normotensives. The effects, if present, are small (reducing systolic pressure by about 2 mmHg) and not clinically useful, although if applied on a population-wide basis they might reduce the prevalence of hypertension by about 17 \%. In many countries food producers and food standards agencies are beginning to respond by cutting the salt content of processed foods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The U.S. diet is high in salt, with the majority coming from processed foods. Reducing dietary salt is a potentially important target for the improvement of public health., METHODS: We used the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Policy Model to quantify the benefits of potentially achievable, population-wide reductions in dietary salt of up to 3 g per day (1200 mg of sodium per day). We estimated the rates and costs of cardiovascular disease in subgroups defined by age, sex, and race; compared the effects of salt reduction with those of other interventions intended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease; and determined the cost-effectiveness of salt reduction as compared with the treatment of hypertension with medications., RESULTS: Reducing dietary salt by 3 g per day is projected to reduce the annual number of new cases of CHD by 60,000 to 120,000, stroke by 32,000 to 66,000, and myocardial infarction by 54,000 to 99,000 and to reduce the annual number of deaths from any cause by 44,000 to 92,000. All segments of the population would benefit, with blacks benefiting proportionately more, women benefiting particularly from stroke reduction, older adults from reductions in CHD events, and younger adults from lower mortality rates. The cardiovascular benefits of reduced salt intake are on par with the benefits of population-wide reductions in tobacco use, obesity, and cholesterol levels. A regulatory intervention designed to achieve a reduction in salt intake of 3 g per day would save 194,000 to 392,000 quality-adjusted life-years and \$10 billion to \$24 billion in health care costs annually. Such an intervention would be cost-saving even if only a modest reduction of 1 g per day were achieved gradually between 2010 and 2019 and would be more cost-effective than using medications to lower blood pressure in all persons with hypertension., CONCLUSIONS: Modest reductions in dietary salt could substantially reduce cardiovascular events and medical costs and should be a public health target.

The National Plan to Reduce Public Consumption of Salt/Sodium in Costa Rica 2011 - 2021 was complemented with multisectoral programs and projects specifically designed to: 1) determine sodium intake and the salt/sodium content of the most widely consumed foods; identify the consumer knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors with regard to salt/sodium, their relationship to health, and nutritional labeling; evaluate the cost-effectiveness of measures aimed at reducing the incidence of hypertension; 2) implement strategies to reduce the salt/sodium content of processed foods and foods prepared at home; 3) promote behavioral changes in the population to reduce salt in people's diets; and 4) monitor and evaluate action geared to reducing salt/sodium intake in the population. Meeting the proposed targets will require successful interinstitutional coordination among the strategic actors, the negotiation of commitments with the food industry and food services, and tighter regulation of critical nutrients in foods associated with chronic noncommunicable diseases. Given the progress made during the implementation of the National Plan, Costa Rica is expected to meet the international goal of reducing salt intake.},

Reduction of salt intake therefore represents an effective tool for lowering arterial blood pressure. With respect to public health, a lower salt content in processed food would be a highly efficient and cost effective intervention for the reduction of cardiovascular mortality (opposed by the food industry). Reducing salt intake to below 100 mmol/day (6 g NaCl) lowers blood pressure and strengthens the potential of almost all antihypertensive medication. Reduction of salt intake can, in many cases, be achieved by avoiding adding salt to daily food, in other cases specialized diet counselling is necessary. Reduction of salt intake attenuates thirst, which can be in contradiction with the (unjustified) recommendation to drink 2-3 litres of water per day.},

During the last years a few Western countries have published action programmes regarding Na and hypertension.

The small reductions in sodium intake and increases in potassium intake that might be achieved through propaganda and changes in food processing are unlikely to lower mean blood pressure in Western societies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Africa hypertension is common and stroke is increasing. Detection, treatment and control of high blood pressure (BP) is limited. BP can be lowered by reducing salt intake. In Africa salt is added to the food by the consumer, as processed food is rare. A population-wide approach with programmes based on health education and promotion is thus possible., METHODS: We carried out a community-based cluster randomised trial of health promotion in 1,013 participants from 12 villages (628 women, 481 rural dwellers); mean age 55 years to reduce salt intake and BP. Average BP was 125/74 mmHg and urinary sodium (UNa) 101 mmol/day. A health promotion intervention was provided over 6 months to all villages. Assessments were made at 3 and 6 months. Primary end-points were urinary sodium excretion and BP levels., RESULTS: There was a significant positive relationship between salt intake and both systolic (2.17 mmHg [95\% CI 0.44 to 3.91] per 50 mmol of UNa per day, p {$<$} 0.001) and diastolic BP (1.10 mmHg [0.08 to 1.94], p {$<$} 0.001) at baseline. At six months the intervention group showed a reduction in systolic (2.54 mmHg [-1.45 to 6.54]) and diastolic (3.95 mmHg [0.78 to 7.11], p = 0.015) BP when compared to control. There was no significant change in UNa. Smaller villages showed greater reductions in UNa than larger villages (p = 0.042). Irrespective of randomisation, there was a consistent and significant relationship between change in UNa and change in systolic BP, when adjusted for confounders. A difference in 24-hour UNa of 50 mmol was associated with a lower systolic BP of 2.12 mmHg (1.03 to 3.21) at 3 months and 1.34 mmHg (0.08 to 2.60) at 6 months (both p {$<$} 0.001)., CONCLUSION: In West Africa the lower the salt intake, the lower the BP. It would appear that a reduction in the average salt intake in the whole community may lead to a small but significant reduction in population systolic BP.},

In 2017, hypertension prevalence for inhabitants {$>$}=18 years old was 36.3\%, and its level of knowledge and control ({$<$}140/90 mm Hg) were 61\% and 24\%, respectively. Furthermore, 56\% of people treated with antihypertensive drugs do not reach therapeutic goal. In addition to this, prevalence of other risk factors, such as sedentary lifestyle, overweight-obesity, high blood glucose/diabetes, and high cholesterol, has worsened in the last 5 years. The governmental initiative "Less Salt More Life" intends to reduce salt consumption in the entire population and promoted a National Law, which establishes the progressive salt reduction in processed foods. This initiative is probably related to the reduction of salt use after cooking or sitting at the table, observed in the Risk Factors National Survey. Furthermore, previously published studies showed, in relatively small samples from Argentina, that populational blood pressure can be decreased and hypertension control can be improved using community-based or multicomponent intervention programs. However, no specific designed national effort for hypertension control is now officially applied. In consequence, we believe that, in order to increase hypertension control, the effort should not focus on developing new strategies, but on quickly implementing and maintaining those local multicomponent interventions that have already proven to be effective.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet enhances potassium intake and reduces sodium intake and blood pressure (BP), but the underlying metabolic pathways are unclear., OBJECTIVES: Among free-living populations, we delineated metabolic signatures associated with the DASH diet adherence, 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretions, and the potential metabolic pathways involved., METHODS: We used 24-hour urinary metabolic profiling by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize the metabolic signatures associated with the DASH dietary pattern score (DASH score) and 24-hour excretion of sodium and potassium among participants in the United States (n = 2164) and United Kingdom (n = 496) enrolled in the International Study of Macro- and Micronutrients and Blood Pressure (INTERMAP). Multiple linear regression and cross-tabulation analyses were used to investigate the DASH-BP relation and its modulation by sodium and potassium. Potential pathways associated with DASH adherence, sodium and potassium excretion, and BP were identified using mediation analyses and metabolic reaction networks., RESULTS: Adherence to the DASH diet was associated with urinary potassium excretion (correlation coefficient, r = 0.42; P {$<$} 0.0001). In multivariable regression analyses, a 5-point higher DASH score (range, 7 to 35) was associated with a lower systolic BP by 1.35 mmHg (95\% CI, -1.95 to -0.80 mmHg; P = 1.2 x 10-5); control of the model for potassium but not sodium attenuated the DASH-BP relation. Two common metabolites (hippurate and citrate) mediated the potassium-BP and DASH-BP relationships, while 5 metabolites (succinate, alanine, S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide, 4-hydroxyhippurate, and phenylacetylglutamine) were found to be specific to the DASH-BP relation., CONCLUSIONS: Greater adherence to the DASH diet is associated with lower BP and higher potassium intake across levels of sodium intake. The DASH diet recommends greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and other potassium-rich foods that may replace sodium-rich processed foods and thereby influence BP through overlapping metabolic pathways. Possible DASH-specific pathways are speculated but confirmation requires further study. INTERMAP is registered as NCT00005271 at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

Whilst the UK has made the most progress on salt reduction, South Africa was the first country to pass legislation for salt levels in a range of processed foods. This paper compares the process of developing salt reduction strategies in both countries and highlights lessons for other countries. Like the UK, the benefits of salt reduction were being debated in South Africa long before it became a policy priority. Whilst salt reduction was gaining a higher profile internationally, undoubtedly, local research to produce context-specific, domestic costs and outcome indicators for South Africa was crucial in influencing the decision to legislate. In the UK, strong government leadership and extensive advocacy activities initiated in the early 2000s have helped drive the voluntary uptake of salt targets by the food industry. It is too early to say which strategy will be most effective regarding reductions in population-level blood pressure. Robust monitoring and transparent mechanisms for holding the industry accountable will be key to continued progress in each of the countries.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Universal salt iodization is an effective strategy to optimize population-level iodine. At the same time as salt-lowering initiatives are encouraged globally, there is concern about compromised iodine intakes. This study investigated whether salt intakes at recommended levels resulted in a suboptimal iodine status in a country where salt is the vehicle for iodine fortification., METHODS: Three 24-h urine samples were collected for the assessment of urinary sodium and one sample was taken for urinary iodine concentrations (UICs) in a convenience sample of 262 adult men and women in Cape Town, South Africa. Median UIC was compared across categories of sodium excretion equivalent to salt intakes lower than 5, 5 to 9, and greater than or equal to 9 g/d., RESULTS: The median UIC was 120 mug/L (interquartile range 75.3-196.3), indicating iodine sufficiency. Less one-fourth (23.2\%) of subjects had urinary sodium excretion values within the desirable range (salt {$<$}5 g/d), 50.7\% had high values (5-9 g/d), and 22.8\% had very high values ({$>$}=9 g/d). No association between urinary iodine and mean 3 x 24-h urinary sodium concentration was found (r = 0.087, P = 0.198) and UIC status did not differ according to urinary sodium categories (P = 0.804)., CONCLUSION: In a country with mandatory universal salt iodization, consumers with salt intakes within the recommended range ({$<$}5 g/d) are iodine replete, and median UIC does not differ across categories of salt intake. This indicates that much of the dietary salt is provided from non-iodinated sources, presumably added to processed foods. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Considering population ageing, the projections for the next decades are alarming. In addition to its epidemiological importance, atrial fibrillation is evidenced by its clinical repercussions, including thromboembolic phenomena, hospitalizations, and a higher mortality rate. Its pathophysiological mechanism is complex and involves an association of hemodynamic, structural, electrophysiological, and autonomic factors. Since the 1990s, the Framingham study of multivariate analyses has demonstrated that hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and valvular disease are independent predictors of this rhythm abnormality along with age. However, various other risk factors have been recently implicated in an increase of atrial fibrillation cases, such as sedentary behavior, obesity, sleep disorders, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol use. Moreover, changes in quality of life indicate a reduction in atrial fibrillation recurrence, thus representing a new strategy for excellence in the treatment of this cardiac arrhythmia. Therapeutic management involves a broad knowledge of the patient's health state and habits, comprehending 4 main pillars: lifestyle changes and rigorous treatment of risk factors; prevention of thromboembolic events; rate control; and rhythm control. Due to the dimension of factors involved in the care of patients with atrial fibrillation, integrated actions performed by interprofessional teams are associated with the best clinical results.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate population health benefits and cost-effectiveness of interventions for reducing salt in the diet., DESIGN: Proportional multistate life-table modelling of cardiovascular disease and health sector cost outcomes over the lifetime of the Australian population in 2003., INTERVENTIONS: The current Australian programme of incentives to the food industry for moderate reduction of salt in processed foods; a government mandate of moderate salt limits in processed foods; dietary advice for everyone at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and dietary advice for those at high risk., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs measured in Australian dollars for the year 2003. Health outcomes measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted over the lifetime., RESULTS: Mandatory and voluntary reductions in the salt content of processed food are cost-saving interventions under all modelled scenarios of discounting, costing and cardiovascular disease risk reversal (dominant cost-effectiveness ratios). Dietary advice targeting individuals is not cost-effective under any of the modelled scenarios, even if directed at those with highest blood pressure risk only (best case median cost-effectiveness A\$100 000/DALY; 95\% uncertainty interval A\$64 000/DALY to A\$180 000/DALY). Although the current programme that relies on voluntary action by the food industry is cost-effective, the population health benefits could be 20 times greater with government legislation on moderate salt limits in processed foods., CONCLUSIONS: Programmes to encourage the food industry to reduce salt in processed foods are highly recommended for improving population health and reducing health sector spending in the long term, but regulatory action from government may be needed to achieve the potential of significant improvements in population health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite many decades of declining mortality rates in the Western world, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this research we evaluate the optimal mix of lifestyle, pharmaceutical and population-wide interventions for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease., METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a discrete time Markov model we simulate the ischaemic heart disease and stroke outcomes and cost impacts of intervention over the lifetime of all Australian men and women, aged 35 to 84 years, who have never experienced a heart disease or stroke event. Best value for money is achieved by mandating moderate limits on salt in the manufacture of bread, margarine and cereal. A combination of diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor and low-cost statin, for everyone with at least 5\% five-year risk of cardiovascular disease, is also cost-effective, but lifestyle interventions aiming to change risky dietary and exercise behaviours are extremely poor value for money and have little population health benefit., CONCLUSIONS: There is huge potential for improving efficiency in cardiovascular disease prevention in Australia. A tougher approach from Government to mandating limits on salt in processed foods and reducing excessive statin prices, and a shift away from lifestyle counselling to more efficient absolute risk-based prescription of preventive drugs, could cut health care costs while improving population health.},

  abstract = {Excessive dietary sodium intake increases blood pressure and cardiovascular risk. In Western diets, the majority of dietary sodium comes from packaged and prepared foods (=75\%); however, in Mexico there is no available data on the main food sources of dietary sodium. The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize the major food sources of dietary sodium in a sample of the Mexican Salt and Mexico (SALMEX) cohort. Adult male and female participants of the SALMEX study who provided a complete and valid three-day food record during the baseline visit were included. Overall, 950 participants (mean age 38.6 +/- 10.7 years) were analyzed to determine the total sodium contributed by the main food sources of sodium identified. Mean daily sodium intake estimated by three-day food records and 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 2647.2 +/- 976.9 mg/day and 3497.2 +/- 1393.0, in the overall population, respectively. Processed meat was the main contributor to daily sodium intake, representing 8\% of total sodium intake per capita as measured by three-day food records. When savory bread (8\%) and sweet bakery goods (8\%) were considered together as bread products, these were the major contributor to daily sodium intake, accounting for the 16\% of total sodium intake, followed by processed meat (8\%), natural cheeses (5\%), and tacos (5\%). These results highlight the need for public health policies focused on reducing the sodium content of processed food in Mexico.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Dietary salt intake has been causally linked to high blood pressure and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular disease causes approximately 35\% of total UK deaths, at an estimated annual cost of 30 billion. The World Health Organization and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have recommended a reduction in the intake of salt in people's diets. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of four population health policies to reduce dietary salt intake on an English population to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD)., METHODS: The validated IMPACT CHD model was used to quantify and compare four policies: 1) Change4Life health promotion campaign, 2) front-of-pack traffic light labeling to display salt content, 3) Food Standards Agency working with the food industry to reduce salt (voluntary), and 4) mandatory reformulation to reduce salt in processed foods. The effectiveness of these policies in reducing salt intake, and hence blood pressure, was determined by systematic literature review. The model calculated the reduction in mortality associated with each policy, quantified as life-years gained over 10 years. Policy costs were calculated using evidence from published sources. Health care costs for specific CHD patient groups were estimated. Costs were compared against a "do nothing" baseline., RESULTS: All policies resulted in a life-year gain over the baseline. Change4life and labeling each gained approximately 1960 life-years, voluntary reformulation 14,560 life-years, and mandatory reformulation 19,320 life-years. Each policy appeared cost saving, with mandatory reformulation offering the largest cost saving, more than 660 million., CONCLUSIONS: All policies to reduce dietary salt intake could gain life-years and reduce health care expenditure on coronary heart disease.

Changes in the purchase of salt in England and Wales are compared with changes in mortality from cerebrovascular disease (1958-78). Stroke mortality, a major sequel of hypertension, has declined in this period. Consumer purchases of salt have decreased also, as suggested by the National Food Survey. While these trends are consistent with the salt-hypertension hypothesis, the picture is confused by an increase in meals eaten outside the home, by the consumption of more processed food, and by a higher prevalence of refrigerators. Other events, such as medical treatment of hypertension or changes in the case fatality rate, could have contributed to the decline in stroke mortality. This secular trend analysis, using available data, does not clarify the salt-hypertension debate.},

While Brazilian studies have analysed that this consumption may have no direct relationship with the processing, but rather with the addition of salt. The purpose of this study is to investigate the contribution of the consumption of processed products in the daily intake of sodium ingestion by atherosclerotic disease patients., METHODS: A sub study, conducted with data from 630 cardiopathic patients who take part in "Effect of Brazilian Cardioprotective Food Program study on the reduction of events and risk factors in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease part". Food was classified as: unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods, ultra-processed food and beverages. Twenty-four-hour food recall (R24h) was collected from patients, and the estimation of total calories and sodium intake were calculated, as well as the percentage of sodium contribution according to the categories already mentioned. For the adequacy ratio analysis, the daily values of sodium intake were used to compared to the recommendations of the World Health Organization ({$<$}2000 mg / day)., RESULTS: The average sodium intake was 1970.87 mg for women and 2642.86 mg for men, being higher for males' patients aged 60-79. It was observed that 64\% of the studied population demonstrated sodium intake {$>$} 2000 mg. When considered levels {$>$} 3001 mg, a higher incidence of consumption was observed in the male group. Only 21.1\% were intaking sodium within the recommended amount. Industrialized foods contributed to 33\% of the mineral intake., CONCLUSION: These findings have demonstrated that the majority of the studied patients exceeded the dietary sodium recommendation. It has also indicated that patient's male, have presented increased consumption of the mineral. Consequently, warning for the necessity of greater investments in the nutritional re-education of these patients. Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Food consumption was recorded by the semiquantitative questionnaire of frequency of food consumption and converted to energy (kcal/day). Foods were classified as minimally processed, group 1 (G1); processed foods, group 2 (G2); and ultra-processed foods, group 3 (G3). The variables evaluated were sex, socioeconomic class, color, physical activity, body mass index, and blood pressure levels. In the comparison of quantitative variables, the Mann-Whitney test and the Kruskal-Wallis H test were used. To adjust the differences between the groups, considering the effects of total calories, the covariance analysis test (ANCOVA) was applied., RESULTS: The median of the total energy consumption was 3,039.8 kcal, and that of ultra-processed foods was 1,496.5 kcal/day (49.23\%). The caloric intake from foods in G1, G2, and G3 did not differ according to the skin color of the adolescents. Those belonging to socioeconomic classes C and D are the most frequent consumers of calories from G2 and G3 (p{$<$}0.001). Underactive teens consume fewer calories from minimally processed foods.

To preliminary verify the intervention approach and the effects of using an m-Health application on the health conditions of patients with AH for a future study, we conducted a non-randomized, controlled, non-blind trial (N = 39), comparing the use of a mobile health app (m-Health) with conventional AH monitoring over 3 months. During the study, we promoted health information workshops to engage patients from both intervention and control groups. Pre and post-intervention, we compared measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure; food frequency questionnaire; Appraisal of Self-Care Agency Scale; blood tests of hemogram, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, lipid profile, and glycemia. Improvements were identified in both groups due to the workshops, including the reduction in total and non-HDL cholesterol, healthier consumption of salads and sugary drinks, and increased self-care scores. Exclusively in the intervention group, which used the m-Health app, there was a change in systolic and diastolic pressure towards more adequate levels. In addition, the intervention group had improved levels of glucose and HDL cholesterol and reduced consumption of ultra-processed foods. In conclusion, the use of an m-Health app had positive effects on the health conditions of patients with AH under treatment within FHS, especially when combined with health information. On the context of FHS, the use of technology is encouraging supporting better health conditions.},

Leading scientific organizations and governmental agencies advise limiting sodium intake to 2400 mg or less daily (approximately 6000 mg of salt). Substantial public health benefits accrue from small reductions in the population blood pressure distribution. A 1.3-g/d lower lifetime sodium intake translates into an approximately 5-mm Hg smaller rise in systolic blood pressure as individuals advance from 25 to 55 years of age, a reduction estimated to save 150,000 lives annually. With an appropriate food industry response, combined with consumer education and knowledgeable use of food labels, the average consumer should be able to choose a lower-sodium diet without inconvenience or loss of food enjoyment. In the continued absence of voluntary measures adopted by the food industry, new regulations will be required to achieve lower sodium concentrations in processed and prepared foods.},

  abstract = {The importance of sodium balance avoiding intradialytic cardiovascular instability and interdialytic hypertension and pulmonary edema is well known. An early analytical single-pool kinetic model created to evaluate sodium balance in hemodialysis, using flame photometry to determine plasma and dialysate sodium concentrations, has been shown to have a level of imprecision of +/- 2.8 mEq/l in predicting end-dialysis sodium plasma water concentrations (NaPWt). The ionometric determination of sodium concentrations seems to be more accurate and refers to the activity of the sodium capable of crossing dialysis membranes. On the basis of the theoretical premises of the model mentioned above, we developed a computerized single-pool kinetic model which makes it possible to calculate the ionized dialysate sodium activity (NaDI) required to reach a pre-established target of end-dialysis blood sodium activity (NaBI). Thirty-seven non-diabetic and anuric patients undergoing regular thrice-weekly hemodialysis were given their usual dialysis treatment, with NaDI at the usual value for each patient (range 137-147 mEq/l) and kept constant throughout dialysis. At the beginning and end of the session, NaDI and NaBI were measured in quadruplicate by means of a Nova-1 device (Direct Potentiometry, Pabisch Instruments). The validity of this kinetic model was tested by considering the difference between predicted and observed (P-O) NaBI at the end of dialysis [(t)]. P-O NaBI(t) was -0.37 +/- 0.42 mEq/l, which was statistically different from 0 (p {$<$} 0.001). When P-O NaBI(t) was plotted against ONaBI(t), it was more negative at the higher values of ONaBI(t). P-O intradialytic sodium removal (Nag) was -12.5 +/- 17.8 mEq/session, which was also statistically different from 0 (p {$<$} 0.001). The imprecision of this kinetic model was less than 0.84 mEq/l, as estimated by doubling the SD of P-O NaBI(t) (0.42 = 0.84 mEq/l). Although the reasons for its inaccuracy especially at higher ONaBI(t) values remain to be clarified, these data are the expression of a satisfactory clinical model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intervention strategies to reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake may decrease blood pressure; however, most are focused on reducing sodium in processed food globally., OBJECTIVES: We attempt to fill important gaps in understanding the dynamics of these dietary determinants of hypertension in China., METHODS: We used data on 29,926 adults aged {$>$}=20 y between 1991 and 2015 from an ongoing cohort, the China Health and Nutrition Survey. We collected detailed diet data with use of weighing methods with 3 consecutive 24-h recalls. With panel data random-effects models, we analyzed factors associated with sodium and potassium intakes and sodium to potassium (Na/K) ratios., RESULTS: Sodium intake decreased from 6.3 g/d in 1991 to 4.1 g/d in 2015, still twice the tolerable upper intake recommended by the WHO. Potassium intake was 1.7 g/d in 1991 and 1.5 g/d in 2015, below half that recommended by the WHO. The Na/K ratio decreased from 4.1 (ratios in g) in 1991 to 3.1 in 2015, 5 times the recommendation of the WHO. More than two-thirds (67\%) of sodium intake was from salt added during food preparation, with 8.8\% from processed foods in 2015, up from 5.0\% in 1991. The most at-risk populations lived in China's central region and rural areas, were middle aged, had lower educations, or were farmers., CONCLUSIONS: Sodium intake is very high across all regions in China. As part of sodium reduction efforts, China should target people living in the central region and adults aged above 60 whose sodium intakes are much higher. Strategies to decrease sodium intake and increase potassium intake should be different from those applied in the Western world where the major source is processed food. Reduced sodium higher potassium salts should become a major policy initiative in China. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Africa has introduced regulations to reduce sodium in processed foods. Assessing salt consumption with 24-h urine collection is logistically challenging and expensive. We assess the accuracy of using spot urine samples to estimate 24-h urine sodium (24hrUNa) excretion at the population level in a cohort of older adults in rural South Africa., METHODS: 24hrUNa excretion was measured and compared to that estimated from matched spot urine samples in 399 individuals, aged 40-75 years, from rural Mpumalanga, South Africa. We used the Tanaka, Kawasaki, International Study of Sodium, Potassium, and Blood Pressure (INTERSALT), and Population Mean Volume (PMV) method to predict 24hrUNa at the individual and population level., RESULTS: The population median 24hrUNa excretion from our samples collected in 2017 was 2.6 g (interquartile range: 1.53-4.21) equal to an average daily salt intake of 6.6 g, whereas 65.4\% of participants had a salt excretion above the WHO recommended 5 g/day. Estimated population median 24hrUNa derived from the INTERSALT, both with and without potassium, showed a nonsignificant difference of 0.25 g (P = 0.59) and 0.21 g (P = 0.67), respectively. In contrast, the Tanaka, Kawasaki, and PMV formulas were markedly higher than the measured 24hrUNa, with a median difference of 0.51 g (P = 0.004), 0.99 g (P = 0.00), and 1.05 g (P = 0.00) respectively. All formulas however performed poorly when predicting an individual's 24hrUNa., CONCLUSION: In this population, the INTERSALT formulas are a well suited and cost-effective alternative to 24-h urine collection for the evaluation of population median 24hrUNa excretion. This could play an important role for governments and public health agencies in evaluating local salt regulations and identifying at-risk populations. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Major gaps exist in knowledge regarding these issues in China., OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the patterns and trends of dietary sodium intake, potassium intake, and the Na/K ratio and their relations with incident hypertension in China., DESIGN: The China Health and Nutrition Survey cohort includes 16,869 adults aged 20-60 y from 1991 to 2009. Three consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and condiment and food weights provided detailed dietary data. Multinomial logistic regression models determined trends and patterns of sodium and potassium intake and the Na/K ratio. Models for survival-time data estimated the hazard of incident hypertension., RESULTS: Sodium intake is decreasing but remains double the Institute of Medicine recommendations. Most sodium comes from added condiments. Adults in the central provinces have the highest sodium intake and the most rapid increase in hypertension. Potassium intake has increased slightly but is below half of the recommended amount. The Na/K ratio is significantly higher than the recommended amounts. Recent measurements of high sodium intake, low potassium intake, and high Na/K ratio have strong independent dose-response associations with incident hypertension., CONCLUSIONS: Reducing sodium in processed foods, the major public health strategy in Western countries, may be less effective in China, where salt intake remains high. Replacing sodium with potassium in salt to control and prevent hypertension in China should be considered along with other public health and clinical prevention options.},

All other healthy individuals are recommended to achieve dietary sodium intakes of less than 2,300 mg per day. Americans are consuming excessive amounts of dietary sodium in the form of processed foods, which poses a barrier to blood pressure control. Pharmacists should recommend the DASH diet as a way to reduce intake of dietary sodium and use available nutrition resources found on the ChooseMyPlate.gov and Food and Drug Administration websites. Pharmacists should integrate approaches using behavioral and motivational strategies to provide education that is culturally sensitive and appeals to individuals with marginal health literacy., CONCLUSION: Community and ambulatory practice pharmacists, as well as collaborative practice models between pharmacists and physicians, should optimize medication management and incorporate lifestyle interventions that reduce dietary sodium intake as part of a comprehensive approach to improve hypertension outcomes.},

Sodium reduction is one of the primary methods recommended for these purposes. The general public is interested in the reduction of dietary sodium intake and has responded with a decrease in table salt use, the purchase of lowered sodium food products, and the use of food labels to help guide food purchases. Countervailing trends in the use of convenience foods and dining out increase the difficulty for individuals to lower sodium intake. Clinical trials that have used sodium reduction alone or in combination with other lifestyle therapies have demonstrated the feasibility of reducing dietary sodium intake from 30\% to 50\% for up to 4 years, in a variety of populations. Trials that used lifestyle and weight loss interventions have also achieved significant reductions in body weight and alcohol consumption and increases in physical activity. A variety of studies indicate that long-term sodium reduction is feasible and that it is acceptable to patients. No negative consequences of these interventions have been observed, and in some cases improvement in the intake of other nutrients has occurred. Nonpharmacological interventions have resulted in hypertension control in significant proportions of the trial populations. These studies demonstrate that the foregoing types of interventions can significantly contribute to hypertension treatment and prevention.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown daily salt intakes in Turkey to be far above the recommended limits. Knowing the sources of dietary salt could form a basis for preventive strategies aimed towards salt reduction. This study aimed to investigate dietary sources of salt in Turkey. A sub-group (n = 657) was selected from the PatenT2 study population, which represented the urban and rural areas of 4 major cities (Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, and Konya). A questionnaire inquiring about sociodemographic characteristics, medical histories, detailed histories of diet, and salt consumption was completed. Participants were asked to collect a 24-h urine sample and to record their food intake (dietary recall) on the same day. Of 925 participants selected, 657 (71\%) provided accurate 24-h urine collections, based on creatinine excretion data. The mean daily 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 252.0 +/- 92.2 mmol/day, equal to daily salt intake of 14.8 +/- 5.4 g. Of the 657 participants with accurate 24-h urine collections, 464 (70\%) provided fully completed dietary recalls. Among these 464 participants, there was a significant difference between the 24-h urinary sodium excretion-based salt intake estimation (14.5 +/- 5.1 g/day) and the dietary recall-based salt intake estimation (12.0 +/- 7.0 g/day) (p {$<$} 0.001). On the other hand, a positive correlation was obtained between the dietary recall-based daily salt intake and 24-h urinary sodium excretion-based daily salt intake (r = 0.277, p {$<$} 0.001). Bread was the main source of salt (34\%) followed by salt added during cooking and preparing food before serving (30\%), salt from various processed foods (21\%), and salt added at the table during food consumption (11\%). Conclusively, this study confirmed a very high salt intake of the adult population in four major cities in Turkey. The present findings support the emerging salt reduction strategy in Turkey by promoting lower salt content in baked bread, and less salt use in habitual food preparation and during food consumption in the home.},

This is a randomised, controlled, single-blind clinical trial with forty-nine adult women with PGDM, followed at a public maternity hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The control group (CG) received a standard diet consisting of 45-55 \% of the total energy intake of carbohydrates, 15-20 \% of proteins and 25-30 \% of lipids. The DASH group (DG) received an adapted DASH diet, which did not differ from the standard diet in the percentage of macronutrients, but had higher contents of fibre, unsaturated fats and minerals such as Ca, Mg and K; and lower contents of Na and saturated fats than the standard diet. In the analysis by protocol, the DG presented a higher incidence of glycaemic control after 12 weeks of intervention (57.1 v. 8.3 \%, P = 0.01, moderate effect size) and a lower mean consumption of UPF (-9.9 \%, P = 0.01) compared with the CG. There was no statistically significant difference in fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations, or in the consumption of PF between the groups (P {$>$} 0.05). The DASH diet may be a strategy for glycaemic control in pregnant women with PGDM, favouring the adoption of a nutritionally adequate diet with lower consumption of UPF. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of the DASH diet on glycaemic profile, and maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with PGDM.},

Ultra-processed foods contribute \textasciitilde 80\% of dietary salt in high income countries, and are becoming prominent in low-middle income countries. Instant noodle consumption is particularly high in the Asia Pacific region. The aim of this study was to compare the sodium content of instant noodles sold worldwide to identify potential for reformulation. Analysis was undertaken for 765 instant noodle products from 10 countries using packaged food composition databases of ultra-processed foods compiled by the Global Food Monitoring Group (GFMG) and national shop survey data. Sodium levels were high and variable, within and between countries. Instant noodles in China had the highest mean sodium content (1944 mg/100 g; range: 397-3678/100 g) compared to New Zealand (798 mg/100 g; range: 249-2380 mg/100 g). Average pack size ranged from 57 g (Costa Rica) to 98 g (China). The average packet contributed 35\% to 95\% of the World Health Organization recommended daily salt intake of {$<$}5 g. Forty-one percent of products met the Pacific Island (PICs) regional sodium targets, 37\% met the South Africa 2016 targets, and 62\% met the UK 2017 targets. This study emphasises a need for stronger regulation and closer monitoring to drive rigorous reformulation of salt in ultra-processed foods.},

In the present work, updated estimates of sodium intake, the main food sources, and the prevalence of excessive intakes in a nationwide multi-ethnic sample of Brazilian adults (2017-2018 Brazilian National Dietary Survey) were presented. Based on two 24-h recalls adjusted for the within-person variation, the overall median of sodium intake was 2432 mg. The prevalence of adults exceeding the recommended limits (tolerable upper limit, UL, and the chronic disease risk reduction cut-off point, CDRR) was 61\% and 56\%, respectively. The median sodium intake and proportion of individuals above the limits varied according to the subgroups evaluated. Males and adults (20-29 years) presented the highest excessive sodium intakes, and consequently, lowest adherence rates to UL and CDRR recommendations. The top food sources of sodium were white bread and toast (12.3\%), beans (11.6\%), white rice (10.6\%), beef (7.7\%), and poultry meat (5.5\%). Given the health benefits of dietary sodium reduction, it would be advisable to enhance the current national initiatives of awareness and educational campaigns' combined efforts to reduce sodium in processed foods to effectively decrease this micronutrient intake across the Brazilian population.},

Low-salt bread was evaluated by a panel of taste testers to determine whether a reduced salt bread could remain undetected. French bread accounts for 25\% of the total salt intake in Argentina; hence, reducing its salt concentration from 2\% to 1.4\% was proposed and tested. A crossover trial was conducted to evaluate the reduction in urinary sodium and blood pressure in participants during consumption of the low-salt bread compared with ordinary bread., RESULTS: Average salt content in bread was 2\%. This study evaluated low-salt bread containing 1.4\% salt. This reduction remained mostly undetected by the panels of taste testers. In the crossover trial, which included 58 participants, a reduction of 25 milliequivalents in 24 hour urine sodium excretion, a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 1.66 mmHg, and a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 0.76 mmHg were found during the low-salt bread intake., CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that dietary salt reduction was feasible and well accepted in the population studied through a reduction of salt content in bread. Although the effects on urinary sodium and blood pressure were moderate, a country wide intervention could have a greater public health impact.},

The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of the low glutamate diet, as well as an acute challenge of monosodium glutamate (MSG)/placebo, on resting heart rate, blood oxygenation level, and blood pressure (BP) in this population., METHODS: These data were measured at 4 time points: baseline, after 1 month on the low glutamate diet, and during each challenge week, where subjects were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover challenge with MSG/placebo over 3 days each week. Pre-post diet changes were analyzed using paired t tests, change in the percentage of veterans meeting the criteria for hypertension was compared using chi-square or Fisher exact tests, and crossover challenge results were analyzed using general linear modeling in SAS R 9.4., RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in systolic BP (sitting and recumbent; both P {$<$} .001) and diastolic BP (sitting; P = .02) after 1 month on the diet. The percentage meeting the criteria for hypertension was also significantly reduced (P {$<$} .05). Challenge with MSG/placebo did not demonstrate an acute effect of glutamate on blood pressure., CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings suggest that the low glutamate diet may be an effective treatment for lowering blood pressure in veterans with Gulf War Illness. This dietary effect does not appear to be driven by reduced consumption of free glutamate, but rather, by an increase in consumption of non-processed foods. Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

The Panel of the Consensus Conference recommended as efficacious the following interventions: alcohol restriction for less than two standard drinks per day, reduction of excessive body weight, and reduction of salt intake. There is sufficient scientific evidence for recommending potassium rich diet for normotensives and hypertensive persons. The Panel also concluded that a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological management is an efficacious measure. The Panel at this point of time could not issue recommendations as to the value of relaxation/stress management, physical exercise and calcium intake.},

The effects on blood pressure, volume, heart rate etc. have been studied along with nearly 100-fold changes in salt intake. Disturbances and risks show up in both extreme ends of this intake range, as counterregulatory mechanisms are overswayed, but within a wide (15-20-fold) range mean pressure is usually changed only marginally, both in healthy man and in rats. When the biological setpoint for intake (salt appetite) has been tested in animals it corresponds--when adjusted to man's 65-70 kg bodyweight and metabolic rate--in sheep to 8-9 g/day and in rats to some 15 g, and it is moderately raised by mental stress. Therefore, human intakes around 10 g daily may, after all, reflect our biologically determined setpoint--rather than expressing a hedonistic abuse. When at different salt intakes not only blood pressure but also heart rate (unfortunately often neglected) are recorded, the percentage increase in pressure at high intakes is mostly less than the percentage decrease in heart rate--and vice versa at low intakes. Thus, as the long-term load on left heart and arteries can be approximated to the product of pressure and rate, low intakes often imply increases of long-term load--to which comes that the for the left ventricular coronary supply so important diastolic phase is shortened. Almost throughout such aspects have been overlooked at the--at best--modest reductions of pressure that have been reported at tolerable reductions of salt intake. The same is true concerning results showing how pressure is reduced considerably more by e.g. three weekly hours of physical activity which, in addition, has uniquely beneficial influences on metabolism, immune defences, sympatho-hormonal activity, etc. Towards such a background suggestions concerning overall reductions of salt intake are hardly justified, particularly as the induction of primary (essential) hypertension appears to be far more dependent on present-day psychosocial influences by means of central enhancements of neuro-endocrine activities.--It is a different matter that salt contents in processed foods should be declared, and kept low--first, because "salt sensitivity" is not uncommon, second, salt is then easy to add but impossible to eliminate.},

These two conditions begin with an increase in abdominal adipose tissue, which is metabolically more active, containing a greater amount of resident macrophages compared to other fat deposits. Abdominal adiposity promotes inflammation and oxidative stress, which are precursors of various complications involving MetS components, namely insulin resistance, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. One way to block the effects of oxidative stress would be through the antioxidant defense system, which offsets the excess free radicals. It is known that individuals with metabolic syndrome and obesity have high consumption of fats and sugars originated from processed foods containing high levels of sodium as well as low intake of fruits and vegetables, thus maintaining a state of oxidative stress, that can speed up the onset of MetS. Healthy eating habits could prevent or delay MetS by adding antioxidant-rich foods into the diet.},

The following parameters were measured on all subjects: plasma renin activity and plasma and urinary aldosterone levels (by radioimmunoassay), serum ionic calcium levels (by Nova-2), total serum calcium, and serum and urinary magnesium values (by atomic absorption), serum and urinary sodium and potassium levels (by flame photometry), and creatinine clearance. In the group with low plasma renin activity (group 1), our findings included low serum ionic calcium levels (P less than .001); high coefficients of plasma aldosterone/plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone/plasma renin activity (P less than .001); a significant correlation between the serum ionic calcium level and plasma renin activity (P less than .001); and an inverse correlation between systolic arterial tension and the serum ionic calcium level (P less than .05). These changes were more similar to change described in hypertensive patients with low plasma renin activity than to the findings in group 2 subjects. We speculate that normotensive subjects with low plasma renin activity present significant changes in the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sodium and calcium levels, and that this group is at risk for hypertension.

For the ABI regression model adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, body mass index, and percentage body fat, the only significant predictor was total sugars (P {$<$} .001); patients who did not meet the recommendation had lower ABI values. For the hsCRP-adjusted regression model, the strongest significant predictor was omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (P = .001), indicating that those who did not meet the recommendation had higher hsCRP values. Finally, for the 6MWD-adjusted regression model, folate (P = .011) and dietary score index (P = .014) were significant predictors; those who did not meet the recommendation for folate and those who met 5 or fewer of the 20 recommendations had shorter 6MWD., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAD and IC consume a low-nutrient-dense diet that is deficient in many vitamins, calcium, fruits, and vegetables and contains too much added sugar, saturated and trans fats, and processed foods. In addition, more severe PAD, greater inflammation, and ambulatory dysfunction are independently associated with aspects of a low-nutrient-dense diet, such as too much intake of added sugars, low intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and folate, and meeting the recommended intakes of only five or fewer nutrients.

  abstract = {There is some evidence supporting the beneficial effects of a Paleolithic Diet (PD) on cardiovascular disease risk factors. This diet advises consuming lean meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, and nuts and avoiding intake of grains, dairy products, processed foods, and added sugar and salt. This study was performed to assess the effects of a PD on cardiovascular disease risk factors including anthropometric indexes, lipid profile, blood pressure, and inflammatory markers using data from randomized controlled trials. A comprehensive search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases up to August, 2018. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to estimate the pooled effect size. Meta-analysis of 8 eligible studies revealed that a PD significantly reduced body weight [weighted mean difference (WMD) = -2.17 kg; 95\% CI: -3.48, -0.87 kg], waist circumference (WMD = -2.90 cm; 95\% CI: -4.51, -1.28 cm), body mass index (in kg/m2) (WMD = -1.15; 95\% CI: -1.68, -0.62), body fat percentage (WMD = -1.38\%; 95\% CI: -2.08\%, -0.67\%), systolic (WMD = -4.24 mm Hg; 95\% CI: -7.11, -1.38 mm Hg) and diastolic (WMD = -2.95 mm Hg; 95\% CI: -4.72, -1.18 mm Hg) blood pressure, and circulating concentrations of total cholesterol (WMD = -0.22 mg/dL; 95\% CI: -0.42, -0.03 mg/dL), TGs (WMD = -0.23 mg/dL; 95\% CI: -0.46, -0.01 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (WMD = -0.13 mg/dL; 95\% CI: -0.25, -0.01 mg/dL), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (WMD = -0.41 mg/L; 95\% CI: -0.81, -0.008 mg/L) and also significantly increased HDL cholesterol (WMD = 0.05 mg/dL; 95\% CI: 0.005, 0.10 mg/dL). However, sensitivity analysis revealed that the overall effects of a PD on lipid profile, blood pressure, and circulating CRP concentrations were significantly influenced by removing some studies, hence the results must be interpreted with caution. Although the present meta-analysis revealed that a PD has favorable effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors, the evidence is not conclusive and more well-designed trials are still needed.

Such products often replace healthy dietary components of the native diet, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. Mixed food habits are emerging mainly amongst younger people in the second and third generations, most likely due to acculturation and adoption of a Western lifestyle. Age and immigrant generation are the major factors accounting for changes in dietary habits, whilst income, level of education, dietary laws, religion, and food beliefs are also important factors. Obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension present major problems for the mainstream European population. However, the risk of chronic disease is reported to be higher in ethnic populations, particularly South Asians, African Caribbeans, and Mexicans.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Public health action to reduce dietary salt intake has driven substantial reductions in coronary heart disease (CHD) over the past decade, but avoidable socio-economic differentials remain. We therefore forecast how further intervention to reduce dietary salt intake might affect the overall level and inequality of CHD mortality., METHODS: We considered English adults, with socio-economic circumstances (SEC) stratified by quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation. We used IMPACTSEC, a validated CHD policy model, to link policy implementation to salt intake, systolic blood pressure and CHD mortality. We forecast the effects of mandatory and voluntary product reformulation, nutrition labelling and social marketing (e.g., health promotion, education). To inform our forecasts, we elicited experts' predictions on further policy implementation up to 2020. We then modelled the effects on CHD mortality up to 2025 and simultaneously assessed the socio-economic differentials of effect., RESULTS: Mandatory reformulation might prevent or postpone 4,500 (2,900-6,100) CHD deaths in total, with the effect greater by 500 (300-700) deaths or 85\% in the most deprived than in the most affluent. Further voluntary reformulation was predicted to be less effective and inequality-reducing, preventing or postponing 1,500 (200-5,000) CHD deaths in total, with the effect greater by 100 (-100-600) deaths or 49\% in the most deprived than in the most affluent. Further social marketing and improvements to labelling might each prevent or postpone 400-500 CHD deaths, but minimally affect inequality., CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory engagement with industry to limit salt in processed-foods appears a promising and inequality-reducing option. For other policy options, our expert-driven forecast warns that future policy implementation might reach more deprived individuals less well, limiting inequality reduction. We therefore encourage planners to prioritise equity.},

  abstract = {Ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption has been the focus of major attention due to their potential effects on human health. The aim of this study was to investigate the intake of UPFs in a sample of southern Italian individuals and assess its relationship with nutrient profile and dietary quality parameters. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1936 individuals older than 18 years randomly selected from the general population. A total of 110 food times have been categorized based on the level of processing using the NOVA classification. The average daily energy intake of the sample was 2091.1 kcal, 38.7\% of which were from the NOVA group of unprocessed/minimally processed foods, 5.7\% from processed culinary ingredients, 38.3\% from processed foods, and 17.9\% from the UPFs group. UPFs were more consumed among young, unmarried individuals, with high cultural level, smokers, and often eating out of home. The mean energy share of UPFs varied from 6.3\% of total daily energy intake for individuals in the lowest quintile of UPF consumption to 34.2\% for those in the upper quintile. Within the UPF group, the highest energy contribution was provided by fast foods and sweets. Compared to the lowest quintile of UPF consumption, individuals in the highest quintile consumed, on average, additional 300 kcals per day and less fiber. Some plant-derived vitamins, such as vitamin A and vitamin C showed an inverse trend toward increasing shares of UPF consumption, while sodium intake increased. A significant higher intake of UPFs in individuals meeting the European and Italian dietary recommendations for carbohydrates, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and vitamin E was found, while UPFs were less consumed among those meeting the recommendations for total fats, fiber, sodium, potassium, and vitamin C. Finally, individuals displaying a "healthier" dietary profile, such as higher adherence to either the Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, the Alternate Diet Quality Index, and the Diet Quality Index-International, consumed less UPFs and more unprocessed/minimally processed foods, with minor variation in the other NOVA food categories. In conclusion, consumption of UPF in southern Italy is in line with those reported in some other Mediterranean countries, although it negatively impacted the nutrient profile. It is important to monitor the consumption of UPFs before their availability and popularity put the grounds on younger generations' dietary habits.},

The most common comorbidities were hypertension (76.4\%), heart failure (32.0\%) and diabetes mellitus (28.2\%). A total of 52\% was performing anticoagulant therapy, 29\% antiplatelet agents and 4\% both therapies. Of those with low thrombotic risk, 63.6\% was wrongly performing some kind of antithrombotic therapy; among patients with high risk or valvular disease 56.8\% was properly undergoing anticoagulant therapy., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of atrial fibrillation as well as the frequency of the main comorbidities associated with it are in line with the majority of studies. Although most patients are undergoing oral anticoagulation, only 56.8\% of those with atrial fibrillation was performing adequate antithrombotic therapy as recommended by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, which denote a marked underutilization of this treatment.},

  abstract = {The general intake of salt (sodium chloride) is much higher than the recommended allowances, in part because of added salt in food industry processed food. However, population studies have not been able to show an association between salt intake and unfavorable health outcome. Based on population studies and randomized studies, the effect of an extreme salt reduction of 100 mmol on blood pressure in hypertensive persons is about one third of the effect of antihypertensive medications. This effect-size estimate is based on single measurements of blood pressure and is probably overestimated compared with 24-hour blood pressure measurements. Salt reduction has effects on heart rate and serum levels of renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, and lipids that may be unfavorable. Because of insufficient compliance, extreme salt reduction can only be obtained if salt in food industry processed food is eliminated. The full consequences of such elimination are not known. Other nonpharmacological interventions, such as weight reduction and diets including fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, are probably easier to implement and more effective to decrease blood pressure than salt reduction. Furthermore, salt reduction does not seem to add to the effect size when combined with other nonpharmacological interventions. Salt sensitivity due to sodium channel mutations has been shown in a minority of blacks but not in Caucasians. In conclusion, at present, dietary salt restriction should not be a basic component of antihypertensive therapy.},

Participants completed a questionnaire assessing discretionary salt use and attitudes to salt intake., OUTCOMES: Four hundred and seventy four surveys were collected (65\% female, 77\% Caucasian, 64\% holding a university qualification). Eighty nine percent of respondents were classified as salt users and 11\% as non-salt users. Of the salt users 52\% reported that they always or sometimes add salt during cooking and at the table. Those of Asian descent and younger respondents aged 18-24 years were more likely to be salt users (chi2=12.3, df=2, p{$<$}0.001; chi2=19.2, df=5, p{$<$}0.01)., CONCLUSION: Discretionary salt use remains high. To successfully reduce population dietary salt intake public health campaigns are urgently required and need to include consumer advice to reduce discretionary salt use, whilst reducing the salt added to processed foods. Such campaigns should include younger age groups and should be appropriate for all ethnic backgrounds to raise the awareness of the risks of a high salt diet on health.},

As part of a large study to create the evidence base required to develop a salt reduction strategy for India, we assessed the perspectives of various stakeholders regarding developing an India specific salt reduction strategy., METHODS: A qualitative research design was deployed to elicit various stakeholder's (government and policy-related stakeholders, industry, civil Society, consumers) perspectives on a salt reduction strategy for India, using in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). We used an inductive approach for data analysis. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis method., RESULTS: Forty-two IDIs and eight FGDs were conducted with various stakeholders of interest and relevance. Analysis indicated three major themes: 1. Barriers for salt reduction 2. Facilitators for salt reduction; 3. Strategies for salt reduction. Most of the stakeholders were in alignment with the need for a salt reduction programme in India to prevent and control hypertension and related CVD. Major barriers indicated by the stakeholders for salt reduction in India were social and cultural beliefs, a large unorganized food retail sector, and the lack of proper implementation of even existing food policies. Stakeholders from the food industry reported that there might be decreased sales due to salt reduction. Major facilitators included the fact that: salt reduction is currently a part of the National Multi-Sectoral Action Plan for the prevention and control of NCDs, salt reduction and salt iodine programme are compatible, and that few of the multinational food companies have already started working in the direction of initiating efforts for salt reduction. Based on the barriers and facilitators, few of the recommendations are to generate awareness among consumers, promote salt reduction by processed food industry, and implement consumer friendly food labelling., CONCLUSIONS: In this study of multiple key influential stakeholders in India, most of the stakeholders were in alignment with the need for a salt reduction programme in India to prevent and control hypertension and related CVD. The development and adoption of the National Multi-sectoral Action Plan to reduce premature non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in India, provides a potential platform that can be leveraged to drive, implement and monitor salt reduction efforts.},

  abstract = {This review considers the mechanism, prevention and therapy of sodium-dependent, low-renin, presumably volume-expanded, hypertension. Certain evidence suggests that in susceptible persons the basic problem is a genetic or acquired deficiency in the ability of the kidney to excrete sodium and hence water. This places them at a disadvantage in a society such as ours in which the salt intake is uniformly high, to a large extent because of the salt content in commercially processed foods. Other evidence suggests that the blood pressure level rises in part because the volume expansion evokes the release of an unknown, slowly-acting, pressor agent which operates by stimulating the contractility of cardiovascular muscle through suppression of the cellular sodium-potassium pump, much in the manner of the cardiac glycosides. Several investigators and the Select Committee on GRAS Substances suggest that the incidence of salt-dependent hypertension could be significantly decreased in a society such as ours if salt intake were reduced from the present level of approximately 10 g/day to 12 g/day. An obvious starting point is a reduction of the salt content in processed foods. The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council suggest that a judicious combination of dietary sodium restriction and the use of an appropriate diuretic is the most rational approach to the treatment and management of diseases characterized by retention of sodium.},

Enlarging portion sizes over the past half century has been accompanied by increased intake of protein, sodium, and processed foods while consumption of fruits and vegetables has declined. Overall dietary patterns play a strong role for chronic disease risk including chronic kidney disease. While dietary patterns high in fresh fruits and vegetables and low in red meats, such as the Mediterranean diet, decrease the risk of chronic diseases, the Western diet, characterized by high intake of red meat, animal fat, sweets, and desserts and low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products, increases risk of chronic diseases. In this article, we review the potential mechanisms whereby several key characteristics of the typical Western diet may impact kidney disease incidence and progression. We also discuss a public health policy initiative to improve dietary choices. Reducing protein intake to the recommended daily allowance of 0.8 g/kg/day and increasing intake of fruit and vegetables and fiber may mitigate kidney disease progression and reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies., METHODS: A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each participant with special procedures, which included the collection of duplicate samples of salt added to food at the table and in home food preparation., RESULTS: Sodium added to food outside the home was the leading source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9\%) of total sodium intake in the sample. Although the proportion of sodium from this source was smaller in some subgroups, it was the leading contributor for all subgroups. Contribution ranged from 66.3\% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0\% for those 18 to 29 years of age. Sodium inherent to food was the next highest contributor (14.2\%), followed by salt added in home food preparation (5.6\%) and salt added to food at the table (4.9\%). Home tap water consumed as a beverage and dietary supplement and nonprescription antacids contributed minimally to sodium intake ({$<$}0.5\% each)., CONCLUSIONS: Sodium added to food outside the home accounted for =70\% of dietary sodium intake. This finding is consistent with the 2010 Institute of Medicine recommendation for reduction of sodium in commercially processed foods as the primary strategy to reduce sodium intake in the United States., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Trial provides critical data on the impact of a specific diet pattern (low in salt, fat, and processed foods and high in fruit and vegetables) on blood pressure (BP). The effect of compliance with a DASH-type diet on BP in a general population sample is less well defined. We studied associations between a DASH style diet and BP., METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from a study of men and women aged 47-73 years (n = 2,047). Participants completed a physical examination that included 3 standardized clinical BP recordings. A subsample (n = 1,187) had ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM) taken. Diet was assessed using a DASH dietary score constructed from a standard Food Frequency Questionnaire. Lower scores indicated less healthy diets. Hypertension was defined as clinic BP {$>$}= 140/90 mm Hg on medication or as 24-hour ABPM {$>$}= 130/80 mmHg., RESULTS: Inverse associations were evident between DASH and systolic BP (SBP). There was a difference in clinic SBP of 7.5 mm Hg and 5.1 mm Hg and a difference in ABPM SBP of 6.3mm Hg and 5.4mm Hg in men and women, respectively, between the highest and lowest DASH quintiles. In fully adjusted multivariable regression analysis, DASH score was inversely associated with SBP. Clear population differences in SBP were evident across DASH quintiles., CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations indicate that the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adherence to DASH-equivalent diet can reduce BP at the population level. Public policy promoting a DASH-style healthy diet could have a significant impact on population health by reducing average BP in the population.

To face this problem, it is important to identify high consumers as well as the main contributors of salt intake.

Dietary intake was assessed from 24-h-recalls, information on socio-demographic characteristics was obtained using a questionnaire and anthropometric data were measured. Salt intake was significantly higher in males than in females. There was a significant positive association between salt intake and body mass index. No significant differences in salt intake were observed for other variables including affluence, educational level, smoking status and physical activity. The main contributor to salt intake were condiments including table salt (32.6\%), followed by cereals and cereal products (27.0\%), meat and meat products (16.1\%) and dairy products (14.0\%). These results highlight that specific population groups need to be targeted by public health initiatives and that a reduction in salt intake can only be achieved in tandem with the food producers by the reduction of salt in processed foods.},

I conclude that it should be public policy to advise and help Americans to reduce their salt intake. Because even mild hypertension increases risk, the overall problem does not appear to be amenable to treatment, although treatment for those with clinical hypertension will always be needed. There appears to be little likelihood that identification of those "at risk" will be successful, nor does it appear that we have the capacity at this time to conduct successful preventive field trials. It is difficult for the individual to modify his diet alone. The successful strategy is to modify the food supply by changing public demand. The public responds to dietary advice if acceptable and identifiable products are available. Because most of the salt is in commercially prepared foods and because their consumption will increase in the future, the major responsibility for lowering salt consumption will fall on the food manufacturers. They are beginning to respond, and there appears to be ample opportunity for them to reduce the salt content of foods markedly. Our temporary objectives, however, should be modest, because unrealistic objectives only discourage those who attempt to follow them.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excessive salt intake has been associated with hypertension and increased cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Reducing salt intake is considered an important public health strategy in the Netherlands., OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the health benefits of salt-reduction strategies related to processed foods for the Dutch population., DESIGN: Three salt-reduction scenarios were developed: 1) substitution of high-salt foods with low-salt foods, 2) a reduction in the sodium content of processed foods, and 3) adherence to the recommended maximum salt intake of 6 g/d. Health outcomes were obtained in 2 steps: after salt intake was modeled into blood pressure levels, the Chronic Disease Model was used to translate modeled blood pressures into incidences of cardiovascular diseases, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and life expectancies. Health outcomes of the scenarios were compared with health outcomes obtained with current salt intake., RESULTS: In total, 4.8\% of acute myocardial infarction cases, 1.7\% of congestive heart failure cases, and 5.8\% of stroke cases might be prevented if salt intake meets the recommended maximum intake. The burden of disease might be reduced by 56,400 DALYs, and life expectancy might increase by 0.15 y for a 40-y-old individual. Substitution of foods with comparable low-salt alternatives would lead to slightly higher salt intake reductions and thus to more health gain. The estimates for sodium reduction in processed foods would be slightly lower., CONCLUSION: Substantial health benefits might be achieved when added salt is removed from processed foods and when consumers choose more low-salt food alternatives.},

A further reduction to 3 - 4 g/day has a greater effect and there needs to be ongoing consideration of lower targets for population salt intake. Cohort studies and outcome trials have demonstrated that a lower salt intake is related to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Salt reduction is one of the most cost-effective measures to improve public health worldwide. In the Americas, a salt intake of {$>$} 9 g/day is highly prevalent. Sources of salt in the diet vary hugely among countries; in developed countries, 75\% of salt comes from processed foods, whereas in developing countries such as parts of Brazil, 70\% comes from salt added during cooking or at the table. To reduce population salt intake, the food industry needs to implement a gradual and sustained reduction in the amount of salt added to foods in developed countries. In developing countries, a public health campaign plays a more important role in encouraging consumers to use less salt coupled with widespread replacement of salt with substitutes that are low in sodium and high in potassium. Numerous countries in the Americas have started salt reduction programs. The challenge now is to engage other countries. A reduction in population salt intake will result in a major improvement in public health along with major health-related cost savings.},

  abstract = {The United Kingdom has successfully implemented a salt reduction programme. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the programme with an aim of providing a step-by-step guide of developing and implementing a national salt reduction strategy, which other countries could follow. The key components include (1) setting up an action group with strong leadership and scientific credibility; (2) determining salt intake by measuring 24-h urinary sodium, identifying the sources of salt by dietary record; (3) setting a target for population salt intake and developing a salt reduction strategy; (4) setting progressively lower salt targets for different categories of food, with a clear time frame for the industry to achieve; (5) working with the industry to reformulate food with less salt; (6) engaging and recruiting of ministerial support and potential threat of regulation by the Department of Health (DH); (7) clear nutritional labelling; (8) consumer awareness campaign; and (9) monitoring progress by (a) frequent surveys and media publicity of salt content in food, including naming and shaming, (b) repeated 24-h urinary sodium at 3-5 year intervals. Since the salt reduction programme started in 2003/2004, significant progress has been made as demonstrated by the reductions in salt content in many processed food and a 15\% reduction in 24-h urinary sodium over 7 years (from 9.5 to 8.1 g per day, P{$<$}0.05). The UK salt reduction programme reduced the population's salt intake by gradual reformulation on a voluntary basis. Several countries are following the United Kingdom's lead. The challenge now is to engage other countries with appropriate local modifications. A reduction in salt intake worldwide will result in major public health improvements and cost savings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevalence of high blood pressure has been increasing in U.S. children, with implications for long term health consequences. Sodium consumption, a modifiable risk factor for high blood pressure, is above recommended limits and increasing. Very little is known about Latino caregiver beliefs and behaviors around their children's salt consumption., METHODS: In California's Central Valley, qualitative interviews in Spanish investigated low-income caregivers' views and understandings of their children's dietary salt consumption. Thirty individual interviews and 5 focus groups were conducted (N=61). Interview transcripts were translated and transcribed, coded and thematically analyzed., RESULTS: Seven primary topic areas around children's salt intake and its impact on health were identified: children's favorite foods, children's dietary salt sources, superiority of home-cooked foods, salty and sweet foods, managing salt for health, developing children's tastes, and adding salt added at the table. Parents recognize common sources of sodium such as "junk food" and processed food and made efforts to limit their children's consumption of these foods, but may overlook other significant sodium sources, particularly bread, cheese, prepared soups and sports drinks. Caregivers recognize excess salt as unhealthy for children, but don't believe health problems (like high blood pressure) can occur in young children. Nevertheless, they made efforts to limit how much salt their children consumed through a variety of strategies; school meals were a source of high sodium that they felt were outside of their control., CONCLUSION: Latino caregivers are concerned about their children's salt intake and attempt to limit consumption, but some common sources of sodium are under-recognized.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most common bacterial pathogens, and the potential association between H. pylori infection and hypertension are controversial., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clarify their association and provide a new theoretical basis for uncovering the pathogenesis of hypertension., METHODS: Case-control and cross-sectional studies on the association between H. pylori and hypertension published from 1996 to 2019 indexed in PubMed, Google Scholar, Chinese Wan Fang Data, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were estimated. I2 was performed to evaluate the statistical heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Begg's and Egger's test. The extracted data was analyzed in Stata 12.0. Statistical significance was defined as p-value {$<$} 0.05., RESULTS: A total of 17 studies involving 6,376 cases of hypertension and 10,850 controls were enrolled. H. pylori infection rate in hypertension patients and controls were 64.9\% and 56.3\%, respectively. A significantly positive association was shown between H. pylori infection and hypertension with an overall OR of 2.07 (95\% CI: 1.46-2.94; p {$<$} 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that the prevalence of H. pylori infection was associated with hypertension in the region of Asia and the case-control group, ORs (95\% CI) were 2.26 (1.51-3.38) and 2.53 (1.72-3.72), respectively. After stratifying by detection methods, differences still existed in subgroups (all p {$<$} 0.05)., CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicated that H. pylori infection is positively associated with hypertension.},

However, excessive salt intake is associated with high blood pressure. As this effect likely drives cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, excessive salt intake is estimated to cause \textasciitilde 5 million deaths per annum worldwide. Animal research has identified various mechanisms by which high salt intake drives disease in the kidney, brain, vasculature and immune system. The potential for therapeutic interventions in many of these pathways has yet to be tested. Salt-reduction interventions lower blood pressure, but for most individuals, 'hidden' salt in processed foods disconnects salt intake from discretionary control. This problem is compounded by growing inequalities in food systems, which form another hurdle to sustaining individual dietary control of salt intake. The most effective salt-reduction interventions have been implemented at the population level and comprise multi-component approaches, involving government, education and the food industry.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Excess consumption of sodium is an important cause of hypertension, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The higher the level of consumption, the greater is a person's likelihood of developing hypertension. Numerous organizations have recommended reductions in sodium intake in the United States. Roughly 80\% of the sodium consumed by Americans has been added by food manufacturers and restaurants., OBJECTIVE: To compare the mean (SD) levels of sodium for identical products ascertained in 2005, 2008, and 2011., DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison study in an academic research setting., PARTICIPANTS AND EXPOSURES: Center for Science in the Public Interest staff have monitored sodium levels in selected processed foods and fast-food restaurant foods for many years., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sodium content in identical foods, as measured in 2005, 2008, and 2011., RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2011, the sodium content in 402 processed foods declined by approximately 3.5\%, while the sodium content in 78 fast-food restaurant products increased by 2.6\%. Although some products showed decreases of at least 30\%, a greater number of products showed increases of at least 30\%. The predominant finding is the absence of any appreciable or statistically significant changes in sodium content during 6 years., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on our sample, reductions in sodium levels in processed and restaurant foods are inconsistent and slow. These findings are in accord with other data indicating the slow pace of voluntary reductions in sodium levels in processed and restaurant foods. Stronger action (eg, phased-in limits on sodium levels set by the federal government) is needed to lower sodium levels and reduce the prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.},

This exploratory study aimed to (i) compare sweet and salty taste detection thresholds and preferences following consumption of ultra-processed and unprocessed diets, (ii) investigate whether sweet and salty taste sensitivity and preference were associated with taste substrates (i.e. sodium and sugar) and ad libitum nutrient intake, and (iii) examine associations of taste detection thresholds and preferences with blood pressure (BP) and anthropometric measures following consumption of ultra-processed and unprocessed diets. In a randomized crossover study, participants (N = 20) received ultra-processed or unprocessed foods for 2 weeks, followed by the alternate diet. Baseline food intake data were collected prior to admission. Taste detection thresholds and preferences were measured at the end of each diet arm. Taste-substrate/nutrient intake, body mass index (BMI), and body weight (BW) were measured daily. No significant differences were observed in participant salt and sweet detection thresholds or preferences after 2 weeks on ultra-processed or unprocessed diets. There was no significant association between salt and sweet taste detection thresholds, preferences, and nutrient intakes on either diet arm. A positive correlation was observed between salt taste preference and systolic BP (r = 0.59; P = 0.01), BW (r = 0.47, P = 0.04), and BMI (r = 0.50; P = 0.03) following consumption of the ultra-processed diet. Thus, a 2-week consumption of an ultra-processed diet does not appear to acutely impact sweet or salty taste sensitivity or preference. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03407053.

The demand for absolute proof of the dietary component of disease on a population level ignores both the innate biological susceptibility in only a portion of the population to a particular nutrient as well as the increasing evidence from studies on non-human primates that diet plays a key role in several conditions including heart disease. Government remains unsure of how to implement its own current recommendations and the traditional paternalistic and conservative approach delays action. Vested interests, seeking only short-term gains, are not confined to industrial concerns. Marketing Boards are allowed almost unfettered freedom to promote nutritionally undesirable eating habits. Health education in schools remains inadequate with most of the involved teachers still promoting incorrect concepts. The medical profession is still unwilling to take a physician maintaining treatment programmes for marginal effects on a public health problem. General practitioners are better able to start practising preventive medicine but they need to be helped by community physicians who should begin on their main task of implementing policies for preventing disease rather than limiting themselves to their current preoccupation with systems analyses and operational research.},

Therefore, we aimed to describe knowledge and behaviors related to salt intake in Mozambique., SUBJECTS/METHODS: A cross-sectional evaluation of a representative sample of the population aged 15-64 years (n = 3116) was conducted in 2014/2015, following the Stepwise Approach to Chronic Disease Risk Factor Surveillance, including a 12-question module for evaluation of dietary salt., RESULTS: Three dimensions were identified in the questionnaire, named "self-reported salt intake", "knowledge of health effects of salt intake", and "behaviors for control of salt intake". A total of 7.4\% of the participants perceived that they consumed too much/far too much salt and 25.9\% reported adding salt/salty seasoning often/always to prepared foods. The proportion considering that it was not important to decrease the salt contents of their diet was 8\%, and 16.9\% were not aware that high salt intake could be deleterious for health. Prevalences of lack of behaviors for reducing salt intake ranged from 74.9\% for not limiting consumption of processed foods, to 95\% for not buying low salt alternatives. There were few differences according to socio-demographic variables, but awareness of hypertension was, in general, associated with better knowledge and less frequent behaviors likely to contribute to a high salt intake., CONCLUSIONS: Most Mozambicans were aware that high salt intake can cause health problems, but the self-reported salt intake and behaviors for its control show an ample margin for improvement. This study provides evidence to guide population level salt-reducing policies.},

Daily salt intake in most of the European countries substantially exceeds the current recommendations of salt intake. For Germany, so far, no valid biomarker-based data on current daily salt intake are available., METHODS: Data basis for this biomarker-based estimation of salt intake in the German population was the representative DEGS Study (German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults) conducted 2008-2011 in 18-79 old adults living in Germany. Daily salt intake was estimated from 6,962 sodium and creatinine measurements in spot urine samples., RESULTS: Median estimated daily salt intake of the 18-79 olds was 10.0 g in men and 8.4 g in women. More than 75\% of men and about 70\% of women exceeded the current recommendation of a maximum salt intake of 6 g/day. Fifty percentage of men and more than 35\% of the women had a daily salt intake {$>$}10 g., CONCLUSION: Daily salt intake of the German population considerably exceeds the current recommendation to eat no more than 6 g salt per day. A general reduction of salt content in processed foods-which are currently the main source of salt intake-offers a promising and cost-effective potential for the improvement of all salt intake-dependent health outcomes in the population.},

Daily salt is double the recommended daily quantity and mainly comes from processed food. The assessment of daily salt intake for Croatia is 12 g/day (WHO recommendation is {$<$}5 g/day). The main source of sodium is processed food and food prepared in restaurants (77\%), natural content of sodium in food (12\%), added salt at table (6\%) and prepared meals at home (5\%). Reduction of salt by 50\% would save nearly 180,000 lives per year in Europe. It is necessary to establish better collaboration with food manufacturers in order to reduce the content of salt in processed food and to achieve appropriate salt intake per day in accordance with the WHO recommendation. Further, it is necessary to encourage food manufacturers to produce food and meals with low or reduced salt content (shops, catering, changes in recipes, offer salt substitutions). This kind of collaboration is based on bilateral interests that can result in positive health effects. One of the most important public health tasks is to educate consumers and to give them choice when buying food. This can be achieved by effective campaigns and social marketing, by ensuring a declaration of salt content on the product, or specially designed signs for food products with low or reduced salt content.},

Potassium chloride is the most widely used salt substitute for sodium chloride in different processed foods. Akkawi cheese, commonly consumed as fresh cheese, has a semi-hard curd, chalky color, firm texture and salty flavor. The effect of partial replacement of NaCl with KCl on the chemical, textural, microbiological and sensory characteristics of fresh and mature Akkawi cheese was investigated., RESULTS: Salt treatment (NaCl reduction) had a significant effect on pH, lactic acid, sodium and potassium contents of cheeses. Texture profile analysis revealed a significant effect of salt treatment on adhesiveness, chewiness and hardness of cheese. All tested microorganisms increased with storage but in general did not differ between salt treatments, specifically between control (100\% NaCl) and (70\% NaCl, 30\% KCl) samples. Descriptive analysis showed that salt treatment had a significant effect on bitterness, crumbliness and hardness, whereas the age of cheese was significant for color and fermented flavor. Salt treatment had no effect on acceptability variables for all experimental 2-week Akkawi samples., CONCLUSION: The above results suggest that a 30\% substitution of NaCl by KCl (70\% NaCl, 30\% KCl brine) is acceptable.

The sodium intakes markedly exceed even the level of 2500 mg, which has been recently given as the maximum level of daily intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects on blood pressure or otherwise. By contrast, the present average potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes are remarkably lower than the recommended intake levels (DRI). In USA, for example, the average intake of these mineral nutrients is only 35-50\% of the recommended intakes. There is convincing evidence, which indicates that this imbalance, that is, the high intake of sodium on one hand and the low intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium on the other hand, produce and maintain elevated blood pressure in a big proportion of the population. Decreased intakes of sodium alone, and increased intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium each alone decrease elevated blood pressure. A combination of all these factors, that is, decrease of sodium, and increase of potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes, which are characteristic of the so-called Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets, has an excellent blood pressure lowering effect. For the prevention and basic treatment of elevated blood pressure, various methods to decrease the intake of sodium and to increase the intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium should be comprehensively applied in the communities. The so-called 'functional food/nutraceutical/food-ceutical' approach, which corrects the mineral nutrient composition of extensively used processed foods, is likely to be particularly effective in producing immediate beneficial effects. The European Union and various governments should promote the availability and use of such healthier food compositions by tax reductions and other policies, which make the healthier choices cheaper than the conventional ones. They should also introduce and promote the use of tempting nutrition and health claims on the packages of healthier food choices, which have an increased content of potassium, calcium, and/or magnesium and a lowered content of sodium. Such pricing and claim methods would help the consumers to choose healthier food alternatives, and make composition improvements tempting also for the food industry.},

Nutritional policies for improving the nation's diet could prevent cardiovascular diseases, but scientific evidence on their costs and outcomes is limited. This study gives an overview of health economic evaluation studies on population-wide dietary salt-reduction policies that have been instituted for the purposes of cardiovascular disease prevention. Thus, this study provides background information for the development of evaluation methods that can be utilized in Japan for analyzing the effects of nutritional policies on public health and social security cost containment. Methods We extracted representative health economic simulation models that are used for predicting the effects of cardiovascular disease-related interventions: Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, IMPACT Coronary Heart Disease Policy and Prevention Model, US IMPACT Food Policy Model, Assessing Cost-Effectiveness (ACE) approach to priority-setting, and Prevention Impacts Simulation Model (PRISM). Next, we collected original articles on studies that used these models for assessing the costs and effects of national population-wide dietary salt-reduction policies. We then outlined the background, structure, and applied studies associated with each model. Results The five models utilized Markov cohort simulation, microsimulation, proportional multistate life tables, and system dynamics to predict the effect of dietary salt-reduction policies on blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular disease prevention. The models were applied to countries such as Australia, England, and the United States to simulate long-term (10 years to lifetime) costs and effects. These applied studies examined policies that included health promotion campaigns, sodium labels on the front of food packages, and mandatory or voluntary reformulation by the food industry to reduce the salt content of processed foods. Conclusion Health economic simulation modeling is actively being used to evaluate scientific evidence on the costs and outcomes of national dietary salt-reduction policies. Similarly, leveraging simulation modeling techniques could facilitate the evaluation and planning of dietary salt-reduction policies and other nutritional policies in Japan.},

Animal experimental data indicate that dietary phosphate excess engages multiple mechanisms that promote hypertension, including overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, increased vascular stiffness, impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, as well as increased renal sodium absorption or renal injury. These effects may be explained by direct effects of high extracellular phosphate levels or increase in phosphaturic hormones such as fibroblast growth factor 23, or downregulation of klotho, a transmembrane protein expressed in multiple organs which possess antiaging property., SUMMARY: Dietary phosphate, particularly inorganic phosphate, is an emerging risk factor for hypertension which is ubiquitous in the western diet. Large randomized clinical trials are needed to determine if lowering dietary phosphate content constitutes an effective nonpharmacologic intervention for prevention and treatment of hypertension.},

But high sodium intake is not only a risk factor for hypertension but also for cardiovascular diseases. Moderate reduction of daily salt intake in the entire population of Germany from the present level of 8-10 mg to 5-6 mg is of great benefit for disease load and to the economy. Any possible risk for a few groups of persons is predictable and can be coped with. General sodium reduction cannot be achieved only by individual advice, instruction or information campaigns but requires a reduction in the sodium content of industrially processed foods, in fast-food chains, restaurants and canteens because they supply 80\% of total daily sodium intake. To achieve the target of restricting the sodium intake of the whole population it is recommended that an interdisciplinary and interprofessional task force, "Less salt for all" be established. This is to bring together the expertise of scientific societies and institutions that see their main task in the reduction of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity by primary prevention. Individual prevention in patients at risk can be very significantly improved by population-related preventive measures. These include, in addition to general limitation of sodium intake, continuing change in lifestyle.},

As the cardiovascular risk is known to rise steadily with systolic blood pressure values starting from 115 mm Hg, lowering the mean blood pressure of the general population by dietary salt restriction would seem to be a practicable form of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease., METHOD: Selective literature search and review., RESULTS: Multiple studies have shown dietary salt restriction to be associated with lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The reduction of adjusted relative risk in controlled observational studies ranges from 25\% over 15 years to 41\% over three years., CONCLUSION: On the basis of the available studies, it seems likely that a moderate lowering of the daily intake of sodium chloride by the general population from 8 to 12 grams per day (the current value) to 5 to 6 grams per day would be a useful public health measure, with economic benefits as well. The potential risks for certain groups of individuals are foreseeable and controllable. A general reduction of dietary salt intake can only be achieved by reducing the sodium chloride content of industrially processed foods, as these account for 75\% to 80\% of the sodium chloride consumed daily. Aside from a general reduction of dietary salt intake, further important primary prevention measures for the general population include changes in lifestyle and in dietary habits.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in adults in Argentina. Sodium reduction policies targeting processed foods were implemented in 2011 in Argentina, but the impact has not been evaluated. The aims of this study are to use Argentina-specific data on sodium excretion and project the impact of Argentina's sodium reduction policies under two scenarios - the 2-year intervention currently being undertaken or a more persistent 10 year sodium reduction strategy., METHODS: We used Argentina-specific data on sodium excretion by sex and projected the impact of the current strategy on sodium consumption and blood pressure decrease. We assessed the projected impact of sodium reduction policies on CVD using the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Policy Model, adapted to Argentina, modeling two alternative policy scenarios over the next decade., RESULTS: Our study finds that the initiative to reduce sodium consumption currently in place in Argentina will have substantial impact on CVD over the next 10 years. Under the current proposed policy of 2-year sodium reduction, the mean sodium consumption is projected to decrease by 319-387 mg/day. This decrease is expected to translate into an absolute reduction of systolic blood pressure from 0.93 mmHg to 1.81 mmHg. This would avert about 19,000 all-cause mortality, 13,000 total myocardial infarctions, and 10,000 total strokes over the next decade. A more persistent sodium reduction strategy would yield even greater CVD benefits., CONCLUSION: The impact of the Argentinean initiative would be effective in substantially reducing mortality and morbidity from CVD. This paper provides evidence-based support to continue implementing strategies to reduce sodium consumption at a population level.},

The best model consisted of age, body weight, dietary behavior ('eating salty food', 'Kimchi consumption', 'Korean soup or stew consumption', 'soy sauce or red pepper paste consumption'), and smoking status in men, and age, body weight, dietary behavior ('salt preference', 'eating salty food', 'checking sodium content for processed foods', 'nut consumption'), and smoking status in women, respectively. When this model was tested in the external validation set, the mean bias between the measured and estimated 24-h urinary-sodium excretion from Bland-Altman plots was -1.92 (95\% CI: -113, 110) mmol/d for men and -1.51 (95\% CI: -90.6, 87.6) mmol/d for women. The cut-points of sodium intake calculated based on the equations were {$>$}=4,000 mg/d for men and {$>$}=3,500 mg/d for women, with 89.8 and 76.6\% sensitivity and 29.3 and 64.2\% specificity, respectively. In this study, a habitual 24-hour urinary-sodium-excretion-estimation model of normotensive Korean adults based on anthropometric and lifestyle factors was developed and showed feasibility for an asymptomatic population.},

  abstract = {Iodine deficiency is a global issue and affects around 2 billion people worldwide, with pregnant women as a high-risk group. Iodine-deficiency prevention began in the 20th century and started with global salt iodination programmes, which aimed to improve the iodine intake status globally. Although it resulted in the effective eradication of the endemic goitre, it seems that salt iodination did not resolve all the issues. Currently, it is recommended to limit the consumption of salt, which is the main source of iodine, as a preventive measure of non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension or cancer the prevalence of which is increasing. In spite of the fact that there are other sources of iodine, such as fish, seafood, dairy products, water, and vegetables, the high consumption of processed food with a high content of unionised salt, alternative diets or limited salt intake can still lead to iodine deficiency. Thus, iodine deficiency remains a relevant issue, with new, preventive solutions necessary. However, it appears that there is no diet which would fully cover the iodine requirements, and iodine food supplementation is still required.},

Salt sensitivity is acquired or genetically-induced and is noted in about 50\% of patients with essential hypertension. This property leads to a high cardiovascular risk. In this situation, the benefit of salt restriction is significant, and this dietary change should be associated with a high potassium intake. In patients treated by antihypertensive drugs, salt restriction improves the blood pressure control, which can permit a reduction of the number of drugs required to achieve a normal blood pressure. The recommended maximal salt intake should not exceed 6 grams/day (NaCl). Because most dietary salt comes from processed foods, the help of the food industry is crucial for a long-term compliance with a reduced salt intake, which could yield an additional important benefit in the reduction of cardiovascular risk.},

  abstract = {High-salt diets are a major cause of hypertension and cardiovascular (CV) disease. Many governments are interested in using food salt reduction programs to reduce the risk for salt-induced increases in blood pressure and CV events. It is assumed that reducing the salt concentration of processed foods will substantially reduce mean salt intake in the general population. However, contrary to expectations, reducing the sodium density of nearly all foods consumed in England by 21\% had little or no effect on salt intake in the general population. This may be due to the fact that in England, as in other countries including the U.S.A., mean salt intake is already close to the lower normal physiologic limit for mean salt intake of free-living populations. Thus, mechanism-based strategies for preventing salt-induced increases in blood pressure that do not solely depend on reducing salt intake merit attention. It is now recognized that the initiation of salt-induced increases in blood pressure often involves a combination of normal increases in sodium balance, blood volume and cardiac output together with abnormal vascular resistance responses to increased salt intake. Therefore, preventing either the normal increases in sodium balance and cardiac output, or the abnormal vascular resistance responses to salt, can prevent salt-induced increases in blood pressure. Suboptimal nutrient intake is a common cause of the hemodynamic disturbances mediating salt-induced hypertension. Accordingly, efforts to identify and correct the nutrient deficiencies that promote salt sensitivity hold promise for decreasing population risk of salt-induced hypertension without requiring reductions in salt intake.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the reduction in blood pressure achieved in trials of dietary salt reduction is quantitatively consistent with estimates derived from blood pressure and sodium intake in different populations, and, if so, to estimate the impact of reducing dietary salt on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease., DESIGN: Analysis of the results of 68 crossover trials and 10 randomised controlled trials of dietary salt reduction., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Comparison of observed reductions in systolic blood pressure for each trial with predicted values calculated from between population analysis., RESULTS: In the 45 trials in which salt reduction lasted four weeks or less the observed reductions in blood pressure were less than those predicted, with the difference between observed and predicted reductions being greatest in the trials of shortest duration. In the 33 trials lasting five weeks or longer the predicted reductions in individual trials closely matched a wide range of observed reductions. This applied for all age groups and for people with both high and normal levels of blood pressure. In people aged 50-59 years a reduction in daily sodium intake of 50 mmol (about 3 g of salt), attainable by moderate dietary salt reduction would, after a few weeks, lower systolic blood pressure by an average of 5 mm Hg, and by 7 mm Hg in those with high blood pressure (170 mm Hg); diastolic blood pressure would be lowered by about half as much. It is estimated that such a reduction in salt intake by a whole Western population would reduce the incidence of stroke by 22\% and of ischaemic heart disease by 16\% [corrected]., CONCLUSIONS: The results from the trials support the estimates from the observational data in the accompanying two papers. The effect of universal moderate dietary salt reduction on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease would be substantial--larger, indeed, than could be achieved by fully implementing recommended policy for treating high blood pressure with drugs. However, reduction also in the amount of salt added to processed foods would lower blood pressure by at least twice as much and prevent some 75,000 [corrected] deaths a year in Britain as well as much disability.},

Excessive dietary salt (sodium chloride and other sodium salts) is a major cause of increased blood pressure, which increases risk for stroke, heart disease, and kidney disease. Reduction in salt intake is beneficial for people with hypertension and those with normal blood pressure. The World Health Organization recommends a population salt intake of less than 5 grams/person/day with a Pan American Health Organization expert group recommendation that this be achieved by 2020 in the Americas. In general, the consumption of salt is more than 6 grams/day by age 5 years, with consumption of salt averaging between 9 and 12 grams per day in many countries. Recent salt intake estimates from Brazil (11 grams of salt/day), Argentina (12 grams of salt/day), Chile (9 grams of salt/day) and the United States (8.7 grams of salt/day) confirm that high salt intakes are prevalent in Americas. Sources of dietary salt vary, from 75\% of it coming from processed food in developed countries, to 70\% coming from discretionary salt added in cooking or at the table in parts of Brazil. The Pan American Health Organization has launched a regionwide initiative called the ?Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Through Dietary Salt Reduction,? led by an expert working group. Working closely with countries, the expert group developed resources to aid policy development through five subgroups: (a) addressing industry engagement and product reformulation; (b) advocacy and communication; (c) surveillance of salt intake, sources of salt in the diet, and knowledge and opinions on salt and health; (d) salt fortification with iodine; and (e) national-level health economic studies on salt reduction.},

Improving knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to salt intake in the general population is a key component of salt reduction strategies. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the KAP of adults related to salt in urban areas of five countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The survey included 588 participants aged 25 to 65 years who were selected using convenience samples in the urban areas of Benin, Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, and Seychelles. Socio-demographic and food consumption were assessed using a structured closed-ended questionnaire administered by survey officers. Height, weight, and blood pressure were measured. Food consumption varied largely between countries. Processed foods high in salt, such as processed meat, cheese, pizzas, and savory snacks were consumed rather infrequently in all the countries, but salt-rich foods, such as soups or bread and salty condiments, were consumed frequently in all countries. The majority of the participants knew that high salt intake can cause health problems (85\%) and thought that it is important to limit salt intake (91\%). However, slightly over half (56\%) of the respondents regularly tried to limit their salt intake while only 8\% of the respondents thought that they consumed too much salt. Salt and salty condiments were added most of the time during cooking (92\% and 64\%, respectively) but rarely at the table (11\%). These findings support the need for education campaigns to reduce salt added during cooking and for strategies to reduce salt content in selected manufactured foods in the region.},

It is widely used as sodium chloride (table salt) in (processed) foods and overconsumed by both children and adults, placing them at risk for adverse health effects such as high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. The current review focusses on the development of salt taste sensitivity and preferences, and its association with food intake. Three -to- four month old infants are able to detect and prefer sodium chloride solutions over plain water, which is thought to be a biological unlearned response. Liking for water with sodium chloride mostly decreases when infants enter early childhood, but liking for sodium chloride in appropriate food contexts such as soup and snack foods remains high. The increased acceptance and preference of sodium chloride rich foods coincides with infants' exposure to salty foods, and is therefore thought to be mostly a learned response. Children prefer higher salt concentrations than adults, but seem to be equally sensitive to salt taste. The addition of salt to foods increases children's consumption of those foods. However, children's liking for salt taste as such does not seem to correlate with children's consumption of salty foods. Decreasing the exposure to salty tasting foods during early infancy is recommended. Salt plays an important role in children's liking for a variety of foods. It is, however, questionable if children's liking for salt per se influences the intake of salty foods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence has shown that lower salt intake reduces hypertension-related disease mortality. Japan has experienced a drastic decrease in cardiovascular mortality, although this varies across regions. This regional variation does not necessarily match the local patterns of reported average salt intake. In this study, we examined population-level risk factors for hypertension-related disease mortality, focussing on the average household dietary consumption of salt intake sources., METHODS: We prepared an ecological panel dataset, with prefecture as the unit of analysis, by referring to public statistics and market research data from 2012 to 2015. We collected prefectural averages of household dietary consumption related to salt intake and other nutrients that may affect hypertension control. We used demographic characteristics, medical care availability and local economy indices as covariates. Panel data analysis with fixed-effects modelling was performed, regressing prefectural-level mortality from ischaemic heart diseases, subarachnoid and intracerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction on dietary consumption and the selected covariates., RESULTS: We confirmed the average household consumption of salt equivalents of discretional salt intake sources to be positively but only weakly associated with mortality from ischaemic heart diseases and cerebral infarction. Household expenditure on processed foods was positively associated with ischaemic heart disease mortality., CONCLUSIONS: These findings may suggest that the reduction of salt in processed foods, in addition to individual behavioural change, could be useful for decreasing mortality from ischaemic heart diseases in the Japanese population. Ecological factors related to decreasing cerebrovascular disease mortality in the context of the ageing Japanese population require further investigation. Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

In Australia, new government-led voluntary measures were initiated in 2009, consisting of public-private partnerships, front-of-pack labelling, and food reformulation targets (which include reduced salt). How Australia's private sector has responded to this healthy eating agenda has been investigated in a limited way, particularly with regards to manufacturers which produce processed foods considered significant sources of sodium. In this study we asked: have Australia's largest food manufacturers made "...positive (nutrition) changes to their product portfolios" as disclosed in their public policies, priorities, and communications? And, is salt reduction a priority for processed food manufacturers? A systematic search and critical content-analysis of grey literature published by food manufacturers was conducted. The results suggest half of the sample publically describe some salt reduction activities but the scale and efficacy of these changes is unclear from the available literature. The Australian Government's Healthy Food Partnership could capitalise on current documented activities in salt reduction, and implement a more comprehensive healthy eating agenda moving forward. In light of the increasing rates of hypertension, population salt consumption and diet-related disease, more could be done.},

Reducing dietary salt consumption is a potentially cost-effective way to reduce blood pressure and the burden of CVD. To date, economic evidence has focused on sodium reduction in food industry or processed food with blood pressure as the primary outcome. This study protocol describes the planned within-trial economic evaluation of a low-sodium salt substitute intervention designed to reduce the risk of stroke in China., METHODS AND ANALYSES: The economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study: a 5-year large scale, cluster randomised controlled trial. The outcomes of interest are quality of life measured using the EuroQol-5-Dimensions and major adverse cardiovascular events. Costs will be estimated from a healthcare system perspective and will be sought from the routinely collected data available within the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted, resulting in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per cardiovascular event averted and cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, respectively., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial received ethics approval from the University of Sydney Ethics Committee (2013/888) and Peking University Institutional Review Board (IRB00001052-13069). Informed consent was obtained from each study participant. Findings of the economic evaluation will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov Registry (NCT02092090).

However, low-sodium diets are frequently considered unpalatable and therefore unfeasible. The objectives of this study were to determine (a) whether hypertensives, treated and untreated, differ in saltiness taste perception from age-matched normotensive controls and (b) whether sodium reduction can be accomplished by substituting another taste stimulus without reducing apparent saltiness and palatability. Subjects included 72 hypertensives, 44 to 69 years old, divided among three treatment groups; 25 age-matched normotensive controls; and an additional 21 normotensives, 20 to 43 years old, to provide an age continuum for evaluating age effects. Taste responses were measured in terms of saltiness intensity and preference using tomato juice varying systematically in sodium chloride and citric acid content. No significant differences were found between normotensives and hypertensives. No significant effects were associated with blood pressure status, therapeutic regimen, age, sex, race, or anthropometric measurements. Both sodium chloride and citric acid were main effects for saltiness, allowing a trade-off between salt and acid. Addition of citric acid permitted 50\% reduction of sodium content in tomato juice without disturbing palatability criteria. Results provide a model for modifying other processed foods.},

The present study aimed to determine the sodium intake in Hong Kong Chinese postmenopausal women and identify the major food sources contributing to sodium intake and urine excretion., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study among 655 Chinese postmenopausal women with prehypertension who were screened for a randomized controlled trial. Data collection included 24 h urine collection for the measurement of sodium, potassium and creatinine, 3-day dietary records, anthropometric measures and questionnaire survey on demographic data and dietary habits., RESULTS: The average salt intake estimated from urinary excretion was 7.8 +/- 3.2 g/d with 82.1\% women above WHO recommendation of 5 g/day. Food groups as soup (21.6\%), rice and noodles (13.5\%), baked cereals (12.3\%), salted/preserved foods (10.8\%), Chinese dim sum (10.2\%) and sea foods (10.1\%) were the major contributors of non-discretionary salt. Discretionary salt use in cooking made a modest contribution to overall intake. Vegetable and fruit intake, age, sodium intake from salted foods, sea foods and soup were the independent determinants of urinary sodium excretion., CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed a significant room for reduction of the sodium intake. Efforts to reduce sodium from diets in Hong Kong Chinese postmenopausal women should focus on both processed foods and discretionary salt during cooking. Sodium reduction in soup and increase in fruit intake would be potentially effective strategy for reducing sodium.},

To test the effect of nutrition education for salt use in third-grade students (ages 7 to 9), three teaching programs involving a classroom curriculum, a home-based curriculum, or the combination were compared to a control group. Thirty-one schools with 1,839 students were included. Measurements were made at the beginning and end of the school year. Participation rates exceeded 90\% for school-based programs and 80\% for those at home. Knowledge about salt increased significantly, with the classroom program showing the largest gains. However, reported salting behavior and sodium measured by 24-hr recall and overnight urines failed to show consistent and significant differences between treatments. Further analysis suggested that most ingested salt was hidden in processed foods with only a small fraction added in cooking or at meals (less than 7\%). If sodium intake is to be reduced significantly in healthy children, more attention must be paid to hidden sources, particularly processed foods.},

In undeveloped communities that do not have access to salt, blood pressure remains low throughout life in comparison with that in developed countries, where blood pressure is higher and increases inexorably with increasing age. An understanding of why blood pressure increases could lead to better preventive strategies, and thereby to a major reduction in cardiovascular disease. Much evidence suggests that salt intake plays an important role in elevating blood pressure. At the same time, elegant cross-transplantation experiments on inherited hypertension in rats and more circumstantial evidence in humans suggests that an inherited abnormality in the kidney, combined with our high salt intake, is likely to explain the development of high blood pressure in individuals. At the same time, studies now show that modest reductions in salt intake cause large decreases in blood pressure in hypertensive individuals and smaller, but very important from a public health perspective, decreases in blood pressure in normotensive people. A large effort is now required to persuade the salt, soft drink, and food manufacturers to reduce the unnecessarily high salt content of processed food.},

  abstract = {Approximately 20\% of American 9 to 18 year olds are obese, and most carry their excess adiposity, with its associated increased risk for cardiovascular disease, into adulthood. We studied cardiovascular disease risk markers changes associated with 3 healthy eating patterns (HEPs) in 96 9 to 18 year olds with a body mass index {$>$}95\% in a Midwestern health system 1-year randomized trial. All HEPs were associated with similar statistically significant (P {$<$} .05 to {$<$}.001) cardiovascular disease risk marker improvements in weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and myeloperoxidase. Time required was the only identified significant (P {$<$} .001) deterrent from enrolling in study. These HEPs had characteristics common to most HEPs: encouraging whole foods, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans other legumes, and limiting added salt, saturated fatty acids, added sugars, red meat, processed meats, and other processed foods. Further research on initiatives to ease the time burden, and increase implementation of established healthy eating principles is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High dietary sodium intake is a leading cause of hypertension. A major source of dietary sodium is salt added to processed food products available in retail food environments. The fast-growing online grocery shopping setting provides new opportunities for salt reduction interventions that support consumers in choosing healthier options., METHODS: The SaltSwitch Online Grocery Shopping randomized controlled trial is investigating the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a novel intervention for lowering salt consumption and blood pressure amongst people with hypertension who shop for groceries online. The intervention is based on a bespoke web browser extension that interfaces with a major retailer's online store to highlight and interpret product sodium content and suggest similar but lower-sodium alternatives. The primary outcome of interest is change in mean systolic blood pressure between individuals randomized (1:1) to the intervention and control (usual online shopping) arms at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes are diastolic blood pressure, spot urinary sodium and sodium:potassium ratio, sodium purchases, and dietary intake. Intervention implementation and lessons for future uptake will be assessed using a mixed methods process evaluation. Participants with hypertension who shop online for groceries and exhibit high sodium purchasing behavior are being recruited across Australia. A target sample size of 1,966 provides 80\% power (2-sided alpha = 0.05) to detect a 2 mm Hg difference in systolic blood pressure between groups, assuming a 15 mm Hg standard deviation, after allowing for a 10\% dropout rate., DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence on an innovative intervention to potentially reduce salt intake and blood pressure in people with hypertension. The intervention caters to individual preferences by encouraging sustainable switches to similar but lower-salt products. If effective, the intervention will be readily scalable at low cost by interfacing with existing online retail environments. Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

The outcome studied was self-reported arterial hypertension. Sociodemographic variables and clinical and lifestyle conditions were considered as exposures. The prevalence ratio (PR), crude and adjusted for sex, age, and schooling was used as a measure of association to verify the factors related to its prevalence, obtained by Poisson regression with robust variance., RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported arterial hypertension was of 23.9\% (95\%CI: 23.4-24.4). When adjusting for age, sex, and schooling, the adjusted Prevalence Ratios (APR) were higher among: regular health self-assessment (APR = 1.6; 95\%CI: 1.5-1.6) and bad health self-assessment (APR = 1.7; 95\%CI: 1.6-1.8); self-reference to heart disease (APR = 1.7; 95\%CI: 1.6-1.7), diabetes (APR = 1.7; 95\%CI: 1.6-1.8), high cholesterol (APR = 1.6; 95\%CI: 1.6-1.7), overweight (APR = 1.4; 95\%CI: 1.4-1.5), and obesity (APR = 2.0; 95\%CI: 1.9-2.1); high salt intake (APR = 1.1; 95\%CI: 1.0-1.1); higher among former smokers (APR = 1.1; 95\%CI: 1.1-1.2) and lower among smokers (APR = 0.9; 95\%CI: 0.8-0.9); and consumption of ultra-processed foods (APR = 0.9; 95\%CI: 0.8-0.9)., CONCLUSION: A quarter of the Brazilian adult population claims to have arterial hypertension, more prevalent among women and associated with older age groups, Black, mixed-race, and others, low schooling, high salt intake, former smoking, presence of comorbidities, and worse health self-assessment.},

Native peoples in Brazil have acquired visibility nationally and internationally, thanks to their mobilization and political organization. Award-winning books have been published such as A Queda do Ceu (The Fall of the Sky) by Davi Kopenawa and Bruce Albert, and Ideias para Adiar o Fim do Mundo (Ideas to Postpone the End of the World) by Ailton Krenak. Freudian-based psychoanalysis keeps silent about native peoples and the new anthropology. The Lacanian psychoanalyst C. Dunker appears more open about it and wrote many articles and one important book on the subject. Jungians are the most enthusiastic and speak out politically about these peoples through courses, study groups, articles, online debates, books and the presence of native leaders and shamans in their conferences. This paper discusses the different perspectives on the issue in the psychoanalytical community, which vary from silence to excitement, and their subjacent political alliances.

  abstract = {This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial using Paleolithic diet and exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that increased adherence to the Paleolithic diet was associated with greater effects on blood pressure, blood lipids and HbA1c independent of weight loss. Participants were asked to follow a Paleolithic diet for 12 weeks and were randomized to supervised exercise or general exercise recommendations. Four-day food records were analyzed, and food items characterized as "Paleolithic" or "not Paleolithic". Foods considered Paleolithic were lean meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruits, nuts, berries, seeds, vegetables, and water to drink; "not Paleolithic" were legumes, cereals, sugar, salt, processed foods, and dairy products. A Paleo ratio was calculated by dividing the Paleolithic calorie intake by total calorie intake. A multiple regression model predicted the outcome at 12 weeks using the Paleo ratio, group affiliation, and outcome at baseline as predictors. The Paleo ratio increased from 28\% at baseline to 94\% after the intervention. A higher Paleo ratio was associated with lower fat mass, BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and serum triglycerides at 12 weeks, but not with lower HbA1c levels. The Paleo ratio predicted triglyceride levels independent of weight loss (p = 0.046). Moreover, an increased monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio and an increased polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio was associated with lower triglyceride levels independent of weight loss. (p = 0.017 and p = 0.019 respectively). We conclude that a higher degree of adherence to the Paleolithic diet recommendations improved fat quality and was associated with improved triglyceride levels independent of weight loss among individuals with type 2 diabetes.},

The present publication describes the macroelement intake., RESULTS: The salt intake is unusually high (17.2 g in men and 12.0 g in women), the potassium intake remains well below the recommendation. These factors substantially increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases including high blood-pressure. The calcium intake stays below the recommendation except in the youngest males, the oldest men and women are at risk from this point of view. While magnesium intake suited the recommendation, the intake of phosphorus exceeded it twice., CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on marcroelements, high sodium/salt intake represents the highest public health risk. The implementation of STOP SALT! National Salt Reducing Programme, i.e. decrease the salt content of processed food and provide proper information to the population about excessive salt consumption, should result in a beneficial change of salt intake and ameliorate the public health conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is rising in middle income countries. Population based strategies to reduce specific CHD risk factors have an important role to play in reducing overall CHD mortality. Reducing dietary salt consumption is a potentially cost-effective way to reduce CHD events. This paper presents an economic evaluation of population based salt reduction policies in Tunisia, Syria, Palestine and Turkey., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Three policies to reduce dietary salt intake were evaluated: a health promotion campaign, labelling of food packaging and mandatory reformulation of salt content in processed food. These were evaluated separately and in combination. Estimates of the effectiveness of salt reduction on blood pressure were based on a literature review. The reduction in mortality was estimated using the IMPACT CHD model specific to that country. Cumulative population health effects were quantified as life years gained (LYG) over a 10 year time frame. The costs of each policy were estimated using evidence from comparable policies and expert opinion including public sector costs and costs to the food industry. Health care costs associated with CHDs were estimated using standardized unit costs. The total cost of implementing each policy was compared against the current baseline (no policy). All costs were calculated using 2010 PPP exchange rates. In all four countries most policies were cost saving compared with the baseline. The combination of all three policies (reducing salt consumption by 30\%) resulted in estimated cost savings of \$235,000,000 and 6455 LYG in Tunisia; \$39,000,000 and 31674 LYG in Syria; \$6,000,000 and 2682 LYG in Palestine and \$1,3000,000,000 and 378439 LYG in Turkey., CONCLUSION: Decreasing dietary salt intake will reduce coronary heart disease deaths in the four countries. A comprehensive strategy of health education and food industry actions to label and reduce salt content would save both money and lives.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization ranks hypertension the leading global risk factor for disease, specifically, cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure (BP) is higher in Westernized populations consuming Na+-rich processed foods than in isolated societies consuming K+-rich natural foods. Evidence suggests that lowering dietary Na+ is particularly beneficial in hypertensive individuals who consume a high-Na+ diet. Nonetheless, numerous population studies demonstrate a relationship between higher dietary K+, estimated from urinary excretion or dietary recall, and lower BP, regardless of Na+ intake. Interventional studies with K+ supplementation suggest that it provides a direct benefit; K+ may also be a marker for other beneficial components of a "natural" diet. Recent studies in rodent models indicate mechanisms for the K+ benefit: the distal tubule Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC) controls Na+ delivery downstream to the collecting duct, where Na+ reabsorbed by epithelial Na+ channels drives K+ secretion and excretion through K+ channels in the same region. High dietary K+ provokes a decrease in NCC activity to drive more K+ secretion (and Na+ excretion, analogous to the actions of a thiazide diuretic) whether Na+ intake is high or low; low dietary K+ provokes an increase in NCC activity and Na+ retention, also independent of dietary Na+ Together, the findings suggest that public health efforts directed toward increasing consumption of K+-rich natural foods would reduce BP and, thus, cardiovascular and kidney disease.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess salt intake is a global issue. Effective salt-reduction strategies are needed, however, as salt is a vehicle for iodine fortification, these strategies may also reduce iodine intake. This study examines the case of the remote Indigenous Australian population; we employed an innovative, objective method to assess sodium and iodine intakes against requirements and modelled the potential effects of salt-reduction strategies on estimated sodium and iodine intakes., DESIGN: Store-sales data were collected from 20 remote Indigenous community stores in 2012-14 representing the main source of food for 2 years for \textasciitilde 8300 individuals. Estimated average sodium and iodine intakes were compared against recommendations (nutrient reference values weighted to age and gender distribution). Linear programming was employed to simulate potential effects of salt-reduction strategies on estimated sodium and iodine intakes., RESULTS: Estimated average sodium intake was 2770 (range within communities 2410-3450) mg/day, far exceeding the population-weighted upper limit (2060 mg/day). Discretionary (added) salt, bread and processed meat were the biggest contributors providing 46\% of all sodium. Estimated average iodine intake was within recommendations at 206 (186-246) mug/day. The following scenarios enabled modelling of estimated average salt intake to within recommendations: 1) 67\% reduction in sodium content of bread and discretionary salt intake, 2) 38\% reduction in sodium content of all processed foods, 3) 30\% reduction in sodium content of all processed foods and discretionary salt intake. In all scenarios, simulated average iodine intakes remained within recommendations., CONCLUSIONS: Salt intakes of the remote Indigenous Australian population are far above recommendations, likely contributing to the high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular mortality experienced by this population. Salt-reduction strategies could considerably reduce salt intake in this population without increasing risk of iodine deficiency at the population-level. These data add to the global evidence informing salt-reduction strategies and the evidence that these strategies can be synergistically implemented with iodine deficiency elimination programmes., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12613000694718.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some available evidence suggests that high consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is associated with a higher risk of obesity. Collectively, this association and the nutritional characteristics of UPFs suggest that UPFs might also be associated with hypertension., METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the relationship between UPF consumption and the risk of hypertension in a prospective Spanish cohort, the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra project. We included 14,790 Spanish adult university graduates who were initially free of hypertension at baseline who were followed for a mean of 9.1 years (SD, 3.9 years; total person-years: 134,784). UPF (industrial formulations of chemical compounds which, beyond substances of common culinary use such as salt, sugar, oils, and fats, include substances also derived from foods but not used in culinary preparations) consumption was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative 136-item food-frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for hypertension incidence., RESULTS: During follow-up, 1,702 incident cases of hypertension were identified. Participants in the highest tertile of UPF consumption had a higher risk of developing hypertension (adjusted HR, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.06, 1.37; P for trend = 0.004) than those in the lowest tertile after adjusting for potential confounders., CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort of Spanish middle-aged adult university graduates, a positive association between UPF consumption and hypertension risk was observed. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our results. Copyright © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2016. All rights reserved.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies on vitamin and mineral intakes in children are very important: firstly because of the high prevalence of diet-related diseases and secondly because of the widespread consumption of highly processed foods which are characterised by high energy content and low density of essential nutrients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyse vitamin and mineral intakes in 6-year-old children from southern Poland., METHODS: Vitamin and mineral intakes were estimated from a three-day food record in 120 children, 64 girls and 56 boys, aged 6 years. Nutrient densities were estimated as amounts per 1000 kcal (4185 kJ) of energy intake. Statistical analysis was carried out by means of the IBM SPSS Statistics computer programme, version 19. The studied population was divided according to gender., RESULTS: Intakes of folic acid (mug/1000 kcal) and vitamin C (mg, mg/1000 kcal) were significantly higher in girls. Nutrient densities for all vitamins were higher in girls, however, these results did not reach statistical significance. Intake of vitamin D was lower than EAR in all of the studied children. Intakes of sodium (mg) and zinc (mg) were significantly higher in boys. Intakes of the remaining minerals were higher in boys, however, these findings did not reach statistical significance. Nutrient densities for all minerals, except for sodium, zinc and manganese, were higher in girls. All of the studied children had sodium intakes above UL., CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate intakes of vitamin D, calcium and potassium in the studied 6-year-olds along with excessive sodium intake are the risk factors for developing osteoporosis and hypertension. To prevent these diseases in the studied children, educational programmes for both preschool staff and parents should be worked out and implemented.},

At baseline and after 6 months, both groups underwent evaluation for weight, blood pressure, VAT, serum sodium, potassium, fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide and creatinine levels, and also the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) by examiners blinded to group allocation. At baseline, the state part of the STAI and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV were also performed, and body mass index, HOMA index and estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated., RESULTS: Data for 159 subjects (89 in group 1, 70 in group 2) were analyzed. Baseline evaluations did not differ between groups. At 6 months, HOMA scores and fasting glucose levels were lower in group 1 than in group 2 (P{$<$}0.01). Also, in group 1, VAT (P=0.006), systolic blood pressure (P=0.001) and BDI-II score (P=0.0005) were decreased, whereas serum fasting glucose (P=0.04) and C-peptide (P=0.03) levels, and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.02), were increased in group 2., CONCLUSION: Consumption of the locally produced food under study improved some of the major risk factors for NCDs after 6 months.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: the relationship between early feeding and blood pressure in later life is still uncertain and sometimes contradictory. Some studies point to the protective effect of breastfeeding on cardiovascular disease, while others do not obtain conclusive results., OBJECTIVES: the aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between breastfeeding patterns during the first months of life and blood pressure in childhood, in two samples of children from two populations with different socio-cultural characteristics, controlling for quality feeding in infancy., METHODS: the study, with a transversal and retrospective design, was conducted with 492 schoolchildren aged between 8 and 10 years, it consists of two samples, both collected from public schools, one in Madrid (Spain) and one in Vitoria, Espirito Santo (Brazil)., RESULTS: ninety percent of the sample was breastfed, 196 (44.2\%) from Madrid and 247 (55.7\%) from Vitoria/ES. The average duration of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in Madrid was 12.89 weeks (std = 9.6) and in Vitoria/ES, 22.00 weeks (std = 13.4), with statistically significant differences. The mean values of systolic and dyastolic blood pressure, were significantly higher in the Brazilian sample. The prevalences of borderline hypertension and hypertension were also higher in Brazil than in Spanish, 68\% vs 32\% and 60\% vs 40\%, respectively. Association between shorter duration of EBF and higher prevalence of hypertension in childhood, was observed in the two samples. Regarding the association between diet quality and blood pressure values, this was only significant in the Brazilian sample, but not in Spanish., DISCUSSION: in both samples a protective effect of breastfeeding on blood pressure was observed, however when comparing the two samples appear to be a contradiction since the Brazilian children were breastfed for longer than the Spaniards but their Pressure Arterial values and the Hypertension prevalence were higher in the Spanish sample. This contradiction is resolved by controlling the effect of feeding in infancy. The food quality of Brazilian children is worse than that of Spaniards, mainly due to a higher consumption of processed foods very high in sodium content., CONCLUSION: the possible protective effect of breastfeeding, is reduced at later stages of the life cycle if food habit are not appropriate or do not meet minimum quality requirements. Therefore, although breastfeeding plays an important role in preventing the development of hypertension in children is not enough to support the practice of breastfeeding but prevention work is ongoing and should insist on eating habits and promote healthy lifestyles throughout the entire life cycle of people.

Systolic blood pressure above 115 mm Hg accounts for two-thirds of strokes and almost half of ischaemic heart disease cases, and cholesterol concentrations exceeding 3.8 mmol/L for 18\% and 55\%, respectively. We report estimates of the population health effects, and costs of selected interventions to reduce the risks associated with high cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure in areas of the world with differing epidemiological profiles., METHODS: Effect sizes were derived from systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and the effect on health outcomes projected over time for populations with differing age, sex, and epidemiological profiles. Incidence data from estimates of burden of disease were used in a four-state longitudinal population model to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted and patients treated. Costs were taken from previous publications, or estimated by local experts, in 14 regions., FINDINGS: Non-personal health interventions, including government action to stimulate a reduction in the salt content of processed foods, are cost-effective ways to limit cardiovascular disease and could avert over 21 million DALYs per year worldwide. Combination treatment for people whose risk of a cardiovascular event over the next 10 years is above 35\% is also cost effective leading to substantial additional health benefits by averting an additional 63 million DALYs per year worldwide., INTERPRETATION: The combination of personal and non-personal health interventions evaluated here could lower the global incidence of cardiovascular events by as much as 50\%.},

To promote population-level salt reduction, the World Health Organization recommends intervention around three core pillars: Reformulation of processed foods, consumer awareness, and environmental changes to increase availability and affordability of healthy food. This review investigates salt reduction interventions implemented and evaluated in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)., METHODS: MEDLINE and google scholar electronic databases were searched for articles meeting inclusion criteria. Studies that reported evaluation results of a salt intervention in SSA were identified. Titles and abstracts were screened, and articles selected for full-text review. Quality of included articles was assessed, and a narrative synthesis of the findings undertaken. PROSPERO registration number CRD42015019055., RESULTS: Seven studies representing four countries-South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and Tanzania-were included. Two examined product reformulation, one in hypertensive patients and the other in normotensive volunteers. Four examined consumer awareness interventions, including individualised counselling and advisory health sessions delivered to whole villages. One study used an environmental approach by offering discounts on healthy food purchases. All the interventions resulted in at least one significantly improved outcome measure including reduction in systolic blood pressure (BP), 24 hour urinary sodium excretion, or mean arterial BP., CONCLUSIONS: More high quality studies on salt reduction interventions in the region are needed, particularly focused on consumer awareness and education in urban populations given the context of rapid urbanisation; and essentially, targeting product reformulation and environmental change, for greater promise for propagation across a vast, diverse continent.},

The average age of patients was 66 years, and 51.6\% of participants were men. Forty-three percent of patients had had a diagnosis of DM for more than 10 years, and 49.7\% had had a diagnosis of hypertension for more than 10 years. Eighty-nine percent of patients had some form of medical insurance. All patients had seen their family physician providers at least once within the past year. Seventy-seven percent of patients reported high adherence as measured by the Morisky scale. On multiple logistic regression, being older than 55, taking more than 7 prescribed medications, and having a lifestyle that included regular exercise or a healthy diet with low salt intake or both were significant independent predictors of high adherence scores on the Morisky scale (P {$<$}= .05)., CONCLUSION: More than three-quarters of patients with type 2 DM and hypertension from community family practice clinics in Maritime Canada reported high adherence to their antihypertensive medications. Family physicians and nurse practitioners can apply strategies to improve antihypertensive medication adherence among type 2 DM patients who are younger, taking fewer medications, or not maintaining a lifestyle that includes regular exercise or a healthy diet or both. Future studies will need to determine whether focusing adherence strategies on these patients will improve their cardiovascular outcomes.},

The paucity of solid studies is striking, but deplorably in line with the paucity of high-quality studies on lifestyle management in general. One hard endpoint study (Sodium-HF) is underway. Promising results were obtained in the GOURMET study, which integrated sodium restriction into a broader nutritional approach that simultaneously targeted malnutrition, a major problem in heart failure. Targeting overall nutritional status - rather than single nutrients - matches current trends in nutrition guidelines, and deserves further exploration. Using fresh products and avoiding processed foods is the main step towards an overall healthier diet with less sodium. Dietary improvement, with its clinical benefit, is feasible in most patients by means of adequate support and feedback. Hopefully, the emergence of 'lifestyle medicine' will, with clinical and scientific effort, allow for the health potential of nutrition to be translated into clinical benefit for patients.},

Approximately 83.2\% of total calories, 79\% of Na+ and 40\% of K+ was derived from the consumption of highly processed foods. Median daily Na+ and K+ intakes were 2759 mg and 2853 mg, respectively. Na+ intakes showed significant nonlinear increases with age (p {$<$} 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) (p {$<$} 0.001), and non-linear decreases with educational attainment (p {$<$} 0.001). K+ intakes showed significant nonlinear decreases with age (p {$<$} 0.001) and BMI (p {$<$} 0.001), and linear increases with educational attainment (p {$<$} 0.001). Males had higher intakes of Na+ and K+ than females. Na+: K+ was lower among persons participating in moderate to high intensity PA {$>$}= 150 minutes/week compared to those participating in such activities {$<$} 150 minutes/week., CONCLUSION: Socio-demographic factors were significantly correlated with Na+ and K+ intakes among participants and must be considered in strategies aimed at achieving healthy intakes of these nutrients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excessive sodium consumption is one of the leading dietary risk factors for non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), mediated by high blood pressure. Brazil has implemented voluntary sodium reduction targets with food industries since 2011. This study aimed to analyse the potential health and economic impact of these sodium reduction targets in Brazil from 2013 to 2032., METHODS: We developed a microsimulation of a close-to-reality synthetic population (IMPACTNCD-BR) to evaluate the potential health benefits of setting voluntary upper limits for sodium content as part of the Brazilian government strategy. The model estimates CVD deaths and cases prevented or postponed, and disease treatment costs. Model inputs were informed by the 2013 National Health Survey, the 2008-2009 Household Budget Survey, and high-quality meta-analyses, assuming that all individuals were exposed to the policy proportionally to their sodium intake from processed food. Costs included costs of the National Health System on CVD treatment and informal care costs. The primary outcome measures of the model are cardiovascular disease cases and deaths prevented or postponed over 20 years (2013-2032), stratified by age and sex., RESULTS: The study found that the application of the Brazilian voluntary sodium targets for packaged foods between 2013 and 2032 could prevent or postpone approximately 110,000 CVD cases (95\% uncertainty intervals (UI): 28,000 to 260,000) among men and 70,000 cases among women (95\% UI: 16,000 to 170,000), and also prevent or postpone approximately 2600 CVD deaths (95\% UI: - 1000 to 11,000), 55\% in men. The policy could also produce a net cost saving of approximately US\$ 220 million (95\% UI: US\$ 54 to 520 million) in medical costs to the Brazilian National Health System for the treatment of CHD and stroke and save approximately US\$ 71 million (95\% UI: US\$ 17 to170 million) in informal costs., CONCLUSION: Brazilian voluntary sodium targets could generate substantial health and economic impacts. The reduction in sodium intake that was likely achieved from the voluntary targets indicates that sodium reduction in Brazil must go further and faster to achieve the national and World Health Organization goals for sodium intake.

This study evaluated the impact of different policy scenarios for reducing sodium consumption from processed and ultra-processed foods in the prevention of deaths due to cardiovascular outcomes in the adult population in Brazil. We used secondary data from public reports and databases of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) and population surveys. We analyzed the impacts, up to 2027, of three scenarios: maintenance of the current voluntary targets, and two mandatory scenarios, considering the lowest targets in the Americas and the lowest global targets. The Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) analyzed the deaths prevented or delayed from sodium consumption in such scenarios. In 2027, more than 72,000 deaths would be attributed to excess sodium; the voluntary goals would result in the prevention or postponement of up to 4,001 (95\% uncertainty intervals - 95\%UI: 1,611-6,563) deaths, while the mandatory scenarios would result in the prevention of 9,704 (95\%UI: 3,955-15,665) and 15,561 (95\%UI: 6,350-25,096) deaths from cardiovascular diseases, considering the lower regional and international targets, respectively. The findings suggest that the maintenance of voluntary targets has limited impact when compared to possible and more restrictive scenarios of reducing sodium content in processed and ultra-processed foods and reinforce the need to adopt measures with greater effectiveness in the country.},

They are the main cause of death in industrialized countries, while the mortality associated with cardiovascular disease is increasing in less developed countries. The modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease are cigarette smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Obesity has been recorded in 10\%-25\% of the population, indicating that poor or inappropriate diet is one of the most common causes of cardiovascular disease. Unhealthy dietary habits including place and way of taking meals, number of daily meals and excessive salt intake from processed foods also contribute to body mass gain. In the present study, dietary habits were assessed in cardiovascular patients versus control group by use of Dietary Habits Questionnaire. Study results showed a statistically significantly higher (P {$<$} 0.05) prevalence of inappropriate eating habits in cardiovascular patients (lower number of daily meals, more often skipping breakfast and having dinner) than in control group. In conclusion, many lifestyle and individual behavior modifications are needed in most patients with or at a high risk of cardiovascular disease.},

Subjects comprised 429 hypertensive patients (206 males, 223 females, and average age of 71 +/- 11 years). We estimated 24-hour salt excretion using spot urine samples and assessed lifestyle using a self-description questionnaire. Average clinic BP and the number of antihypertensive drugs were 132 +/- 11/73 +/- 8 mmHg and 1.8 +/- 0.9, respectively. In all subjects, average estimated salt intake was 9.2 +/- 2.8 g/day and the rate of achievement of the estimated salt intake of {$<$}6 g/day was 11.2\%. In patients with chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular disease, these values were 8.6 +/- 2.6 g/day and 15.5\%, and 9.1 +/- 3.3 g/day and 18.2\%, respectively. Estimated salt intake was lower in patients living alone than in those with a family. In a multivariate analysis, estimated salt intake correlated positively with body mass index and negatively with age. Among patients with an excessive salt intake ({$>$}=10 g/day), 75.2\% answered that they made an effort to reduce their salt intake. The amount of food and processed food consumption correlated with estimated salt intake. In conclusion, the rate of achievement of salt restriction was low in hypertensive patients treated at a general hospital. It may be important to provide data on actual salt intake and guide salt restriction in the individual management of hypertension.},

To prevent/control these risks, reduced salt diet (RSD) is recommended in many countries and some people report practicing it; however, little is known about actual achievement. This population-based study assessed level of 24-h dietary sodium intake of participants reporting RSD and others., METHOD: Participants were 4680 men and women ages 40-59 years randomly selected from 17 populations in People's Republic of China (PRC), Japan, UK and USA, for an observational study on diet and blood pressure (INTERMAP). Daily sodium intake was determined by two timed 24-h urine collections. Antihypertensive treatment status and RSD were ascertained by questionnaire., RESULTS: Participants reporting RSD were few; 3.1\% (Japan), 1.3\% (PRC), 2.5\% (UK), 7.2\% (USA); 15.1, 7.9, 16.7 and 16.8\% of people with treated hypertension. For those reporting RSD, 24-h urinary sodium excretion was significantly, but only modestly lower than for others, by 17.9 mmol/day (Japan), 56.7 (PRC) and 14.7 (USA), but higher by 10.5 in UK. Sodium intakes for participants reporting RSD remained higher than recommended; 181.0 mmol/day (Japan), 171.5 (PRC), 155.2 (UK) and 148.9 (USA). For these people, as for others, main sources of salt were processed foods in Japan, UK and USA; in PRC, salt added in preparation at home., CONCLUSION: Enhanced sustained efforts are needed to raise general awareness of the harmful effects of salt on health and the benefits of salt reduction. Population approaches are needed to reduce salt content of processed foods and restaurant meals.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Introduction: one of the changes in diet is related to its content of sodium (Na) and potassium (K). Greater use of condiments and processed foods contributes to these changes and the Na/K ratio can be used as a marker of this consumption. Objective: to evaluate the association between Na/K ratio and consumption of industrialized condiments and ultra-processed foods. Methods: a sample of 150 adults underwent an anthropometric examination and answered the questionnaire on life habits, diet and health. Consumption of Na, K and salt was estimated by urinary excretion of 24 hours. Ultraprocessed consumption was estimated by 24-hour food registration. Na/K ratio divided into tertiles. Associations between ultraprocessed foods, use of industrialized condiments and Na/K ratio were tested. p {$<$} 0.05 was adopted. Results: the highest proportion was female (65\%) and with a higher educational level (77\%). Higher consumption of ultra-processed foods was observed in men, in those with higher schooling and in non-whites. Those who reported a frequent consumption of industrialized condiments showed a mean sodium of 4.1 +/- 1.4 g/day (p = 0.03) and salt of 10.5 +/- 3.6 g/day (p = 0.03). Among those who reported frequent use of industrialized condiments, a higher Na/K ratio was found and a lower ratio was observed among those with lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods. Hypertensive and those with salt intake above the recommended one presented higher Na/K ratio. Conclusion : frequent consumption of industrialized condiments is associated with higher salt excretion and Na/K ratio and higher consumption of ultraprocessed products increases Na/K ratio.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of hypertension is high and increasing worldwide. Drug therapy is effective, but for both "prehypertensive" and treated hypertensive patients, lifestyle changes are also important. Dietary modification is a key part of these changes, although skepticism about the role of diet in determining blood pressure has slowed implementation of the available guidelines. However, there is now a large body of evidence supporting a role for dietary salt, potassium, alcohol, and body mass in determining blood pressure. Studies such as PREMIER have shown that salt restriction ({$<$}6 g/d), alcohol moderation ({$<$}2U/d in men and {$<$}1U/d in women), weight loss (if BMI{$>$}25), exercise, and a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet (supplying 20-30 mmol/d of potassium) can achieve decreases in systolic blood pressure of approximately 10 to 15 mm Hg when applied together. Of the dietary changes, salt intake remains the most amenable to change. But we must further reduce salt in processed food if it is to be part of a wider strategy to lower blood pressure in the general population. Nevertheless, the message to patients must be that dietary changes made within a concerted alteration in lifestyle can have a very significant impact on their blood pressure.},

A total of 127 African American men and women, aged 21-75 years, completed a self-administered 79-item questionnaire. Data analysis included Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests., OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement or disagreement with current scientific opinion regarding coronary heart disease, obesity, and dietary intake; agreement with statements of personal knowledge of heart disease, hypertension, and dietary intake; assessment and beliefs about the health risks associated with overweight/ obesity; and congruence between dietary knowledge and dietary practices., RESULTS: Women and older respondents tended to agree more with current scientific knowledge about heart disease mortality than did men and younger respondents. Younger respondents reported knowledge but less personal concern about fat intake/heart disease and salt intake/hypertension associations than did other age groups. Participants generally believed that excess weight increased the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer "a lot." Knowledge of the salt content of processed foods was associated with decreased frequency of adding salt at the table, while those not concerned about salt consumption and hypertension were more likely to add salt and consume processed meats. Respondents with knowledge of the effects of fat intake on heart disease were more likely to consume low-fat dairy products., CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that sex and age, in particular, require consideration in the development of community cardiovascular disease intervention programs aimed at southern, rural African American adults.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Policies that address the food environment at the population level may help prevent chronic disease, but their value to society is still uncertain. Dietary sodium is linked to increased prevalence of hypertension, a primary risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases. This study calculates the potential societal savings of reducing hypertension and related cardiovascular disease via a reduction in population-level sodium intake. On average, U.S. adults consume almost twice the recommended maximum of dietary sodium, most of it from processed foods., DESIGN: This study modeled sodium-reduction scenarios by using a cross-sectional simulation approach. The model used population-level data on blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, and sodium intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004). This data was then combined with parameters from the literature on sodium effects, disease outcomes, costs, and quality of life to yield model outcomes., MEASURES: This study calculated the following outcome measures: hypertension prevalence, direct health care costs, and quality-adjusted life years for noninstitutionalized U.S. adults., ANALYSIS: The simulation was conducted with STATA 9.2 and Microsoft Excel. Survey weights were used to calculate population averages., RESULTS: Reducing average population sodium intake to 2300 mg per day, the recommended maximum for adults, may reduce cases of hypertension by 11 million, save \$18 billion health care dollars, and gain 312,000 QALYs that are worth \$32 billion annually. Greater reductions in population sodium consumption bring even greater savings to society., CONCLUSIONS: Large benefits to society may result from efforts to lower sodium consumption on a population level by modest amounts over time.

  abstract = {There are data demonstrating that ingestion of potassium-rich foods reduces the incidence of stroke, hypertension, nephrolithiasis, and osteoporosis. Dietary-consumption data indicate Westernized diets are high in processed foods, high in sodium content, and low in potassium. In fact, there are data suggesting individuals are not consuming enough potassium in their diet. Although consumption of diets high in plant proteins, fruits, and vegetables-which are excellent sources of potassium-is recognized as healthy and beneficial, individuals with decrements in their kidney function have been advised to avoid these foods. In reviewing the literature that provides the rationale for potassium restriction in patients with reductions in kidney function, it appears there is little direct evidence to support the levels of restriction which are now prescribed. Additionally, there are two new potassium-binding agents which are well tolerated and have been documented to be effective in controlling serum potassium. Therefore, with the new binding agents and the lack of empirical evidence supporting the stringent dietary potassium restrictions, the authors conclude by indicating the pressing need for further research focusing on dietary liberalization of potassium in patients with reductions in kidney function to enhance overall health and well being, to provide them cardiovascular benefits, and to reduce overall risk of mortality through the incorporation of potassium-enriched foods.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: High dietary sodium is a leading contributor to hypertension, and hypertension is the leading underlying cause of death globally. There is a robust body of evidence supporting the health benefits of sodium reduction. Sodium intake in South Korea is high, with about half the population consuming {$>$}4000 mg/day, twice the recommended upper limit., METHODS: In 2012, South Korea implemented its National Plan to Reduce Sodium Intake, with a goal of reducing population sodium consumption by 20\%, to 3900 mg/day, by 2020. The plan included five key components: (1) a consumer awareness campaign designed to change food consumption behaviours; (2) increased availability of low-sodium foods at schools and worksites; (3) increased availability of low-sodium meals in restaurants; (4) voluntary reformulation of processed foods to lower sodium content; and (5) development of low-sodium recipes for food prepared at home. Monitoring and evaluation included tracking sodium intake and sources of dietary sodium using the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey., RESULTS: By 2014, South Korea had reduced dietary sodium consumption among adults by 23.7\% compared to a survey conducted in 2010 prior to implementation of a nationwide salt reduction campaign that used this comprehensive, multipronged approach. The reductions in sodium intake were accompanied by reductions in population blood pressure and hypertension prevalence. Although causal associations between the sodium reduction programme and reduced sodium intake cannot be made, the declines occurred with the introduction of the programme., CONCLUSION: Multicomponent interventions have great potential to reduce population sodium intake. Lessons learnt from South Korea could be applied to other countries and are likely very relevant to other Asian countries with similar food sources and consumption profiles.

  abstract = {Stroke is a disease with impacts ranging from death and disability, to reduced health-related quality of life and depression. To truly understand the burden of this disease we must investigate not only the mortality and prevalence of stroke, but also its incidence within populations. Stroke mortality and incidence declined rapidly during the 1980s and early 1990s; however, this trend appears to have slowed in more recent times. Despite many studies being conducted in Europe, and Australasia, there is a lack of reliable data from developing regions such as Asia and Africa. There are indications that although the mortality rate of stroke in such regions may be less than in developed countries, the simple fact that the populations are large means that the burden of stroke is considerable. Furthermore, as a result of epidemiological transition and rapid urbanization and industrialization many developing regions are exhibiting increased life expectancy, as well as changes in diet and other risk behaviors, such as smoking. This is contributing to a looming epidemic of stroke in these regions, as greater proportions of the population are now at risk of stroke. Fortunately, stroke is largely a preventable disease. The major risk factor for stroke, hypertension, can be controlled using both population-wide approaches, such as changes in the salt content of processed foods, and high-risk individual approaches, such as use of antihypertensive medications. Implementation of effective primary and secondary prevention strategies is likely to have an enormous benefit in reducing the burden of stroke, particularly in developing regions.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies report on strong correlation between salt intake and an increased risk of some diseases. Salt intake has long been known to influence blood pressure in patients with hypertension, increased risk of renal disease, cancer and obesity. Salt is an important spice because many foods without salt have unacceptable taste. The major problem arises from the fact that most salt derives from processed foods and reduction of salt content in these sources is necessary to reduce overall salt exposure. Dietitians and/or foodservice managers have professional responsibility to produce quantity food recipes that are reduced in sodium and acceptable to customers. The daily sodium content was assessed in the menus (12 different diets) served to patients at Dubrava University Hospital in Zagreb and Dr. Josip Bencevic General Hospital in Slavonski Brod. The average sodium content in the menus served at these two institutions was 1925 mg/day and 1890 mg/day, respectively. The results indicate that there is sufficient substitute for salt, it is only important to change dietary habits. In conclusion, long-term health benefits will depend on the ability of patients to make long-lasting dietary changes, along with wider availability of lower-sodium foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, which is consistent with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and to avoid foods with high salt content.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sodium consumption is a modifiable risk factor for higher blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed voluntary sodium reduction goals targeting processed and commercially prepared foods. We aimed to quantify the potential health and economic impact of this policy., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a microsimulation approach of a close-to-reality synthetic population (US IMPACT Food Policy Model) to estimate CVD deaths and cases prevented or postponed, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness from 2017 to 2036 of 3 scenarios: (1) optimal, 100\% compliance with 10-year reformulation targets; (2) modest, 50\% compliance with 10-year reformulation targets; and (3) pessimistic, 100\% compliance with 2-year reformulation targets, but with no further progress. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and high-quality meta-analyses to inform model inputs. Costs included government costs to administer and monitor the policy, industry reformulation costs, and CVD-related healthcare, productivity, and informal care costs. Between 2017 and 2036, the optimal reformulation scenario achieving the FDA sodium reduction targets could prevent approximately 450,000 CVD cases (95\% uncertainty interval: 240,000 to 740,000), gain approximately 2.1 million discounted QALYs (1.7 million to 2.4 million), and produce discounted cost savings (health savings minus policy costs) of approximately \$41 billion (\$14 billion to \$81 billion). In the modest and pessimistic scenarios, health gains would be 1.1 million and 0.7 million QALYS, with savings of \$19 billion and \$12 billion, respectively. All the scenarios were estimated with more than 80\% probability to be cost-effective (incremental cost/QALY {$<$} \$100,000) by 2021 and to become cost-saving by 2031. Limitations include evaluating only diseases mediated through BP, while decreasing sodium consumption could have beneficial effects upon other health burdens such as gastric cancer. Further, the effect estimates in the model are based on interventional and prospective observational studies. They are therefore subject to biases and confounding that may have influenced also our model estimates., CONCLUSIONS: Implementing and achieving the FDA sodium reformulation targets could generate substantial health gains and net cost savings.},

Moreover, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) influence BP. For this reason, we investigated whether: 1) children with risk of elevated BP had a higher consumption frequency (CF) of energy-dense salty foods (EDSF), high-sugary foods (HSF) and SSB or a low DASH score; and 2) children with a higher CF of EDSF showed a worse anthropometric and metabolic profile. Anthropometry, BP and general biochemical parameters were measured in 687 Spanish children (5-16 years) with normal or excess weight. A food frequency questionnaire was used to calculate EDSF, HSF and SSB consumption, and modified DASH score. Results showed that sex and pubertal stage influenced modified DASH score. Diastolic hypertension was associated to higher CF of EDSF in the whole sample and to higher CF of SSB in pubertal children, both independently of nutritional status. In addition, CF of EDSF was positively associated with CF of HSF and SSB and inversely associated with modified DASH score. Targeted policies and intervention programs, specific for different age ranges, should be established that aim to reduce salt consumption from snacks and processed foods, which could reduce HSF and SSB consumption as well.},

Participants Adults and older people (n 517) aged 20-80 years, living in Artur Nogueira, Sao Paulo, Brazil., RESULTS: Mean salt intake based on 24 h urinary Na excretion and total reported salt intake was 10.5 and 11.0 g/d, respectively; both measures were significantly correlated. Discretionary salt and seasoned salt were the most important sources of salt intake (68.2 \%). Men in the study consumed more salt than women as estimated by 24 h urinary Na excretion (11.7 v. 9.6 g salt/d; P{$<$}0.0001). Participants known to be hypertensive added more salt to their meals but consumed less salty ultra-processed foods. Waist circumference in both sexes and BMI were positively correlated with salt intake estimated by 24 h urinary Na excretion. In addition, regression analysis revealed that being a young male or having a high waist circumference was a predictor of higher salt intake., CONCLUSIONS: Salt intake in this population was well above the recommended amount. The main source of salt intake came from salt added during cooking. Salt intake varied according to sex and waist circumference.},

The intake of high-sodium processed foods as snacks has gone up worldwide. The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to analyze the association between BP values and sodium intake from snacks., SUBJECTS/METHODS: The mean weekly consumption of snacks was evaluated in 1200 randomly selected adolescents aged 11-13 years by a food-frequency questionnaire; their anthropometric and BP values were measured by trained researchers. A dietary 24-h food-recall questionnaire was randomly given to 400 of the 1200 adolescents., RESULTS: Mean sodium intake from snacks was 1.4 g/day. Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP, respectively) significantly increased from the lower to the higher tertile of sodium from snacks and with increasing frequency of salty snacks consumption. In a multiple logistic regression model, both being in the highest SBP quartile and in the highest DBP quartile were significantly associated with the intake of sodium from snacks (odds ratio (OR)=1.48; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.91 and OR=2.17; 95\% CI 1.68-2.79, respectively), the consumption of {$>$}2/day salty snacks (OR=1.86; 95\% CI 1.32-2.63 and OR=2.38; 95\% CI 1.69-3.37, respectively) and body mass index (OR=1.26; 95\% CI 1.22-1.31 and OR=1.14; 95\% CI 1.10-1.18, respectively) but not with age, sex or exercise levels. In the 400 individuals, the average total sodium intake was 3.1 g/day and was significantly higher in individuals belonging to the highest quartile of SBP and DBP., CONCLUSIONS: Sodium intake from snacks was almost half of the average daily sodium consumption and was significantly associated with BP values in adolescents.},

  abstract = {In South Africa, rapid urbanisation and epidemiological transition have left the black urban population vulnerable to diseases of lifestyle such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and heart disease, as well as chronic heart failure. This is in part due to the fact that changes in dietary patterns during urbanisation play an important role in the increase of risk factors of these diseases. The South African population is made up of many different ethnic and cultural groups, each with its own way of eating and food choices. The black African population is one such an ethnic group, with its own distinct eating patterns and food choices. The diets of people living in rural areas tend to still be higher in carbohydrates, lower in fat, lower in sugar and higher in fibre, corresponding to the more traditional way of eating. With urbanisation their diet has changed to a more westernised diet with the resultant decrease in carbohydrates and fibre and an increased fat, processed food and salt consumption. Factors that might contribute to this change in dietary patterns include lack of awareness and knowledge around nutritional recommendations for persons suffering from chronic heart failure, urbanisation, socio-economic circumstances, food insecurity and level of education. Nutritional recommendations and intervention programs for the prevention and management of CHF focusing on food that is culturally sensitive and affordable should be implemented.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Between the years 1993 and 2008, mortality rates from coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Slovak Republic have decreased by almost one quarter. However, this was a smaller decline than in neighbouring countries. The aim of this modelling study was therefore to quantify the contributions of risk factor changes and the use of evidence-based medical therapies to the CHD mortality decline between 1993 and 2008., METHODS: We identified, obtained and scrutinised the data required for the model. These data detailed trends in the major population cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol, diabetes prevalence, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity levels), and also the uptake of all standard CHD treatments. The main data sources were official statistics (National Health Information Centre and Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic) and national representative studies (AUDIT, SLOVAKS, SLOVASeZ, CINDI, EHES, EHIS). The previously validated IMPACT policy model was then used to combine and integrate these data with effect sizes from published meta-analyses quantifying the effectiveness of specific evidence-based treatments, and population-wide changes in cardiovascular risk factors. Results were expressed as deaths prevented or postponed (DPPs) attributable to risk factor changes or treatments. Uncertainties were explored using sensitivity analyses., RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2008 age-adjusted CHD mortality rates in the Slovak Republic (SR) decreased by 23\% in men and 26\% in women aged 25-74 years. This represented some 1820 fewer CHD deaths in 2008 than expected if mortality rates had not fallen. The IMPACT model explained 91\% of this mortality decline. Approximately 50\% of the decline was attributable to changes in acute phase and secondary prevention treatments, particularly acute and chronic treatments for heart failure (=12\%), acute coronary syndrome treatments (=9\%) and secondary prevention following AMI and revascularisation (=8\%). Changes in CHD risk factors explained approximately 41\% of the total mortality decrease, mainly reflecting reductions in total serum cholesterol. However, other risk factors demonstrated adverse trends and thus generated approximately 740 additional deaths., CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that approximately half the CHD mortality fall recently observed in the SR may be attributable to the increased use of evidence-based treatments. However, the adverse trends observed in all the major cardiovascular risk factors (apart from total cholesterol) are deeply worrying. They highlight the need for more energetic population-wide prevention policies such as tobacco control, reducing salt and industrial trans fats content in processed food, clearer food labelling and regulated marketing of processed foods and sugary drinks.},

On the other hand, the relationship between high salt intake, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease has been proven. Food consumption pattern in Iran shows that consumption of salt, pickled foods and salty snacks is common. Regarding the World Health Organization (WHO) target for salt intake (about 5 g per day), the evidence indicates that Iranian people consume 2-3 times more than the recommended amount of salt. Fortunately, serious attention has been paid to this matter since 2009 and along with arrangements for it, support of all relevant sectors (public and private) has been included in the agenda. At present, reduction of salt intake is among the major priorities of planners, policy makers, and experts of the Iranian health services system. On the other hand, many studies in EMRO have shown high levels of daily salt intake in these countries. In this review, the solutions used in the Islamic Republic of Iran at various levels were considered, including determination of salt intake measurement methods, revision in the amount of salt in processed food products, food labeling, promoting awareness of various social groups, gathering support from all relevant sectors, designing a regular public awareness campaign for reducing salt intake, and lessons learned in this regard, that can be helpful to countries in the region.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: This comprehensive review summarizes the effects of migration and immigration on the development of hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors the world over-Europe, Asia, Africa, North, South and Central America, China, Australia, and the Middle East. The process of acculturation that populations undergo as they move from small, rural, agricultural economies to industrialized towns and cities takes a toll on health and well-being. Surroundings change, a new culture has to be adapted to, a new language learned, lifestyles changed, physical activity often drastically reduced, and major changes made in eating habits as low-sodium low-fat diets are replaced by processed foods and high amounts of salt. Even populations that move from one westernized country to another undergo these traumas., THE RESULTS: increased stress, hypertension, obesity and diabetes. These changes are more severe in the elderly than young people, who adapt to their new home more quickly. While such reactions to migration are seen worldwide, all populations do not respond the same, the result of constitutional differences and of the different cultures from whence they came. These dramatic changes put the onus on the governments and health services of the host countries to tailor prevention and treatment programs to these different populations-proactive programs that are sorely lacking in most countries. The literature documents these phenomena, and can serve as a wake-up call to what is becoming a major worldwide health issue as populations shift and peoples struggle to adapt.

When this technique was applied in an epidemiological context using 12 consecutive 24-hour urine collections, we found that at least 83\% of the salt ingested by a population in Cambridgeshire, England, was derived from processed food. Only a small amount of the total salt intake came from cooking or from using salt on the table. The total amount of salt eaten was not as high as was previously estimated indirectly. There was a clear sex difference in salt intake which in part related simply to the finding that salt intake correlates with body weight of an individual. This study implies that those who wish to advocate a reduction in salt intake in order to prevent hypertension must reconsider their approach. Any health education programme that is geared simply to reduce discretionary salt use in the home, will have little impact on the total amount of NaCl ingested by the population.},

  abstract = {Overweight and obesity have become global concerns in developed and developing countries due to their rise in recent years and their association with the prevalence of non-communicable diseases including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. In fact, it is estimated that roughly 39\% of adults worldwide are overweight and 13\% are obese. Ecuador is an example of a developing country concerned with the overweight and obesity problem, where it is estimated that 30\% of children, 26\% of teenagers and 63\% of adults are either overweight or obese and where 1 in 4 deaths are attributed to chronic diseases. To address the overweight and obesity problem via the promotion of healthy eating habits, in 2013 the country approved technical regulation for the labelling of packed processed food products. The regulation included a mandatory traffic-light (TL) supplemental nutritional information labelling system to be displayed on the package of all processed foods for sale in the country. This new labelling system displays a traffic light panel for the product content of sugar, fat and salt in addition to the traditional nutrient declaration label. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effect of the TL supplemental nutritional information on consumers' buying behavior in Ecuador. More specifically, we concentrated on the purchasing behavior of carbonated soft drinks. For our analysis, we used monthly aggregated purchase data (total expenditures, quantities and average prices) of carbonated soft drinks from January 2013 to December 2015 obtained from Kantar World Panel-Ecuador. We estimated a non-linear Almost Ideal Demand System where we model the demand for high sugar and low sugar carbonated soft drinks. We found that the introduction of the traffic light supplemental nutrition labelling did not have the expected effect of reducing purchases of carbonated soft drinks during its first year of implementation, especially those high in sugar. Additionally, we found that lower income-status households tend to spend more on and consume more calories from CSD than households with higher socio-economic status. Finally, we identified that over time purchases of high sugar soft drinks decreased while purchases of low and no sugar soft drinks increased. Beyond our contribution of evaluating the effect of the traffic light on the purchases of carbonated soft drinks, we also estimated price and income elasticities of carbonated soft drinks which can be useful in the evaluation of fiscal policies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To reduce excess dietary sodium consumption, Nigeria's 2019 National Multi-sectoral Action Plan (NMSAP) for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases includes policies based on the World Health Organization SHAKE package. Priority actions and strategies include mandatory sodium limits in processed foods, advertising restrictions, mass-media campaigns, school-based interventions, and improved front-of-package labeling. We conducted a formative qualitative evaluation of stakeholders' knowledge, and potential barriers as well as effective strategies to implement these NMSAP priority actions., METHODS: From January 2021 to February 2021, key informant interviews (n = 23) and focus group discussions (n = 5) were conducted with regulators, food producers, consumers, food retailers and restaurant managers, academia, and healthcare workers in Nigeria. Building on RE-AIM and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we conducted directed content qualitative analysis to identify anticipated implementation outcomes, barriers, and facilitators to implementation of the NMSAP sodium reduction priority actions., RESULTS: Most stakeholders reported high appropriateness of the NMSAP because excess dietary sodium consumption is common in Nigeria and associated with high hypertension prevalence. Participants identified multiple barriers to adoption and acceptability of implementing the priority actions (e.g., poor population knowledge on the impact of excess salt intake on health, potential profit loss, resistance to change in taste) as well as facilitators to implementation (e.g., learning from favorable existing smoking reduction and advertising strategies). Key strategies to strengthen NMSAP implementation included consumer education, mandatory and improved front-of-package labeling, legislative initiatives to establish maximum sodium content limits in foods and ingredients, strengthening regulation and enforcement of food advertising restrictions, and integrating nutrition education into school curriculum., CONCLUSION: We found that implementation and scale-up of the Nigeria NMSAP priority actions are feasible and will require several implementation strategies ranging from community-focused education to strengthening current and planned regulation and enforcement, and improvement of front-of-package labeling quality, consistency, and use.

Substituting potassium and/or magnesium salts for sodium chloride (NaCl) may enhance the feasibility of salt restriction and lower blood pressure beyond the sodium reduction alone. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and effect on blood pressure of replacing NaCl (Regular salt) with a novel mineral salt [50\% sodium chloride and rich in potassium chloride (25\%), magnesium ammonium potassium chloride, hydrate (25\%)] (Smart Salt)., METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with an intervention period of 8-weeks in subjects (n = 45) with systolic (S)BP 130-159 mmHg and/or diastolic (D)BP 85-99 mmHg. During the intervention period, subjects consumed processed foods salted with either NaCl or Smart Salt. The primary endpoint was the change in SBP. Secondary endpoints were changes in DBP, daily urine excretion of sodium (24-h dU-Na), potassium (dU-K) and magnesium (dU-Mg)., RESULTS: 24-h dU-Na decreased significantly in the Smart Salt group (-29.8 mmol; p = 0.012) and remained unchanged in the control group: resulting in a 3.3 g difference in NaCl intake between the groups. Replacement of NaCl with Smart Salt resulted in a significant reduction in SBP over 8 weeks (-7.5 mmHg; p = 0.016). SBP increased (+3.8 mmHg, p = 0.072) slightly in the Regular salt group. The difference in the change of SBP between study groups was significant (p {$<$} 0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: The substitution of Smart Salt for Regular salt in subjects with high normal or mildly elevated BP resulted in a significant reduction in their daily sodium intake as well as a reduction in SBP.},

Study selection was limited to CEA and CUA conducted in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in English, German or French, without time limit. Outcomes measures were life years gained (LYG), disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Relevant aspects in modelling were analysed and compared. Quality assessments were conducted using the Drummond and Jefferson/British Medical Journal checklist., SETTING: OECD member countries., SUBJECTS: Mainly adults., RESULTS: Fourteen CEA and CUA were included in the review which analysed different strategies: salt reduction or substitution in processed foods, taxes, labelling, awareness campaigns and targeted dietary advice. Fifty-nine out of sixty-two scenarios were cost-saving. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in international dollars (Intl.\$; 2015) was particularly low for taxes, a salt reduction by food manufacturers and labelling (303 900 Intl.\$/DALY). However, only six studies analysed cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective and quality assessments showed flaws in conducting and a lack of transparency in reporting., CONCLUSIONS: A population-wide salt reduction could be cost-effective in prevention of hypertension and CVD in OECD member countries. However, comparability between study results is limited due to differences in modelling, applied perspectives and considered data.},

Decreasing the intake of highly processed foods to which salt has been added and lowering the salt content of these foods seems to be sensible advice on a population level. Salt in food is directly related to blood pressure but also increases the palatability of processed foods and increases thirst, which may contribute to obesity. Reductions in salt intake should be accompanied by an increase in food rich in potassium such as vegetables, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake and the maintenance of a healthy weight. This strategy would not only be beneficial for improved blood pressure control but would also contribute to the general prevention of non-communicable diseases.},

  abstract = {The Hypertension Prevention Trial (HPT) was a multicenter randomized trial designed to assess the effects of long-term dietary changes on blood pressure in a normotensive population (diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 78 but less than 90 mm Hg) for a period of 3 years. The dietary treatments were reduction of sodium intake, increase of potassium intake, and decrease of energy intake. Estimates of changes in food intake were made by comparing 24-hour food records of the treatment and control participants. The participants in the treatment groups reported sodium intakes that were 30\% to 40\% lower than those of the controls. The restriction was achieved mainly by reducing intake of salt, meats, and grain products. Meats and grain products were still a major source of total sodium intake after treatment (41\% to 47\%), perhaps because of continued use of processed foods. Potassium intake was reported to be 16\% to 25\% higher in the treatment groups than in the controls, the increase achieved largely through increased consumption of fruits, with a lesser contribution from vegetables. Participants with higher initial body weights reported smaller increases in fruit and vegetable consumption than participants of normal weight, perhaps because of concerns about weight gain. Energy intake in the weight loss groups was 8\% to 11\% less than that of the controls. Men reported success in restricting calories from meats, dairy products, fats, beverages, and sugars. Women were less successful in restricting calories from most food groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Evidence linking salt and hypertension is on the whole growing stronger, but the situation is still not clear-cut. The relationship between sodium intake and prevalence of hypertension is complicated; it is suggested that in the middle range of sodium intake another factor, possibly linked to the renal handling of sodium, contributes to the prevalence of hypertension. Attitudes among investigators and the medical profession are probably moving toward favouring salt restriction, at least for people with hypertension. The general public is also probably becoming more favourably disposed toward reducing salt consumption. Policies regarding salt in various countries appear to be hesitant, probably reflecting scientific uncertainty. Sodium content should be included on food package labels. SI units should now be universally used for the sodium content of foods on diet sheets and on package labels.},

Several countries, including the United States, are considering strategies to decrease population sodium intake., OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 2 population strategies to reduce sodium intake: government collaboration with food manufacturers to voluntarily cut sodium in processed foods, modeled on the United Kingdom experience, and a sodium tax., DESIGN: A Markov model was constructed with 4 health states: well, acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute stroke, and history of MI or stroke., DATA SOURCES: Medical Panel Expenditure Survey (2006), Framingham Heart Study (1980 to 2003), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial, and other published data., TARGET POPULATION: U.S. adults aged 40 to 85 years., TIME HORIZON: Lifetime., PERSPECTIVE: Societal., OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs (2008 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and MIs and strokes averted., RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Collaboration with industry that decreases mean population sodium intake by 9.5\% averts 513 885 strokes and 480 358 MIs over the lifetime of adults aged 40 to 85 years who are alive today compared with the status quo, increasing QALYs by 2.1 million and saving \$32.1 billion in medical costs. A tax on sodium that decreases population sodium intake by 6\% increases QALYs by 1.3 million and saves \$22.4 billion over the same period., RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results are sensitive to the assumption that consumers have no disutility with modest reductions in sodium intake., LIMITATION: Efforts to reduce population sodium intake could result in other dietary changes that are difficult to predict., CONCLUSION: Strategies to reduce sodium intake on a population level in the United States are likely to substantially reduce stroke and MI incidence, which would save billions of dollars in medical expenses., PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Department of Veterans Affairs, Stanford University, and National Science Foundation.},

  abstract = {Increased consumption of inorganic phosphate (Pi), an abundant ingredient in processed foods, has been associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk; however, studies investigating underlying mechanisms are limited. Recently, high dietary Pi was shown to exaggerate the pressor response to static muscle contraction in rodents in part because of overactivation of metabolically sensitive skeletal muscle afferents. Whether acute high Pi consumption affects muscle metaboreflex activation in humans remains unknown. Furthermore, although acute high Pi consumption has been shown to impair vascular function in young healthy men, equivocal results have been reported. Therefore, we hypothesized that acute high Pi consumption augments mean arterial pressure (MAP) responses during muscle metaboreflex activation, impairs endothelial function, and increases arterial stiffness in young healthy men. Subjects performed 35\% maximal voluntary contraction static handgrip (HG), followed by postexercise ischemia (PEI) to isolate muscle metaboreflex activation. Resting flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and arterial stiffness were assessed. Measures were made before (pre) and 60 min after (post) subjects consumed either a high-phosphate drink (2,000 mg phosphorus and 1,520 mg sodium) or a sodium drink (1,520 mg sodium; control). MAP responses during HG (preDELTA = +23 +/- 3 mmHg; postDELTA = +21 +/- 2 mmHg; P = 0.101) and PEI (preDELTA = +21 +/- 4 mmHg; postDELTA = +18 +/- 3 mmHg; P = 0.184) were similar before and after Pi consumption. In contrast, FMD was significantly attenuated following Pi (pre = 5.1 +/- 0.5\%; post = 3.5 +/- 0.5\%; P = 0.010), whereas arterial stiffness remained unchanged. There were no changes in any measured variable after control drink consumption. In summary, although the muscle metaboreflex remains unaffected following acute high Pi consumption in young healthy men, endothelial function is impaired. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This study was the first to investigate the influence of acute high-phosphate consumption on the pressor response during isometric handgrip and isolated muscle metaboreflex activation during postexercise ischemia in young healthy humans. We demonstrated that a single high dose of phosphate (2,000 mg) did not augment blood pressure in response to exercise or isolated muscle metaboreflex activation, but endothelial function was blunted in young healthy men.},

Traditionally, the study of the relationship between diet and CVD has focused on the analysis of single nutrients, or foods, in relation to CVD risk., OBJECTIVE: In part one of this review, we present current epidemiologic and clinical evidence on nutrition and cardiovascular health with regards to specific foods and nutrients aimed at preventing CVD., METHODS: The Cochrane Library database between 2006 and 2012 was searched for studies on effects of dietary factors on cardiovascular health., DISCUSSION: Evidence is presented on soy protein, fats, fish, nuts, fruit, vegetables, electrolytes, vitamins, and carbohydrate including fibre, glycaemic index, and wholegrains. Evidence from specific foods underpins current dietary CVD prevention guidelines, that advise on replacing saturated with unsaturated fat, consuming carbohydrate foods that are wholegrain or of low glycaemic index, increased consumption of fruit, vegetables (particularly cruciferous), nuts, and oily fish. Other nutrients (such as soya protein, or reducing sodium intake) reduce CVD risk via favourable effects on disease contributors (such as LDL-cholesterol or blood pressure), but also infer/promote dietary change that impacts other nutrients (using less animal or processed foods, resulting in saturated fat reduction). The complexity and limitations of interpreting dietary epidemiologic studies is reviewed. With the general ineffectiveness of nutrient-based intervention, recently the shift has been towards the examination of associations between dietary patterns and cardiovascular health, which will be examined in the second part of this review.},

There is now compelling evidence to support salt reduction in hypertensives and a substantial body of evidence to support salt reduction in the general population to reduce risk of death from cardiovascular disease. In specific diseases such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease, guidelines support the World Health Organization target for reduced salt intake at 5 g daily. Achieving a diet that is lower in salt has challenges, but is more likely to be achieved through salt reduction strategies particularly focused on processed food and through educational programs.

Such foods are often linked with weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension-diseases that are on the rise in India. This paper analysed patterns in purchases of processed and UPF by urban Indian households., SETTING: Panel data from Kantar -Worldpanel Division, India for 2013 and 2016., PARTICIPANTS: 58 878 urban Indian households., METHODS: We used K-mean partition clustering and multivariate regression to analyse patterns in processed food (PF) and UPF purchase for urban India., RESULTS: Three-quarters of urban Indian households purchased over ten PF groups. Mean per person annual PF purchase was 150 kg. UPF purchase was low at 6.4 kg in 2016 but had grown by 6\% since 2013. Cluster analysis identified three patterns of consumption, characterised by low (54\% of the households in 2016), medium (36\%) and high (10\%) PF purchase quantities. High cluster households purchased over three times as much PFs and UPF as the low cluster households. Notably, salt purchases were persistently high across clusters in both years ({$>$}3.3 kg), while sweet snack and ready-to-eat food purchases grew consistently in all clusters between 2013 and 2016. A positive and significant association was found between household purchases of UPF and their socioeconomic status as well as ownership of durables, such as refrigerator, colour television and washing machine (all p{$<$}0.001). Spatial characteristics including size of town (p{$<$}0.05) in which the household is located were also positively associated with the purchase of UPF., CONCLUSION: Results suggest the need for tailored regional and city level interventions to curb the low but growing purchase of UPF. New data on obesity and rise of non-communicable diseases, the results are concerning given the links between lifestyle changes and the speed of urbanisation in Indian cities.

Salt (sodium chloride) is considered the main source of sodium in the human diet, and it is estimated that processed foods and restaurant foods contribute 80\% of the daily intake of sodium in most of the Western world. However, ample research demonstrates the efficacy of sodium chloride against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in a variety of food systems. Notable examples of the utility and necessity of sodium chloride include the inhibition of growth and toxin production by Clostridium botulinum in processed meats and cheeses. Other sodium salts contributing to the overall sodium consumption are also very important in the prevention of spoilage and/or growth of microorganisms in foods. For example, sodium lactate and sodium diacetate are widely used in conjunction with sodium chloride to prevent the growth of Listeria monocytogenes and lactic acid bacteria in ready-to-eat meats. These and other examples underscore the necessity of sodium salts, particularly sodium chloride, for the production of safe, wholesome foods. Key literature on the antimicrobial properties of sodium chloride in foods is reviewed here to address the impact of salt and sodium reduction or replacement on microbiological food safety and quality.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Investigations have brought evidence that salt intake is positively related to systolic blood pressure and that children with higher blood pressure are more susceptible to hypertension in adulthood. In developed countries the main source of salt is processed food., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to determine total sodium chloride (NaCl) in average daily meal (breakfast, snack and dinner) and in each of three meals children receive in kindergarten., METHODS: From kindergarten, in the meal time, 88 samples of daily meals (breakfast, snacks and dinner) offered to children aged 4-6 years were taken. Standardized laboratory methods were applied to determine proteins, fats, ash and water in order to calculate energy value of meal. The titrimetric method with AgNO3, and K2CrO4 as indicator, was applied in order to determine chloride ion. Content of NaCl was calculated as \%NaCl = mlAgNO3 x 0.05844 x 5 x 100/g tested portion. NaCl content in total daily meal and each meal and in 100 kcal of each meal was calculated using descriptive statistical method. Student's t-test was applied to determine statistical differences of NaCl amount among meals., RESULTS: NaCl content in average daily meal was 5.2 +/- 1.7 g (CV 31.7\%), in breakfast 1.5 +/- 0.6 g (CV 37.5\%), in dinner 3.5 +/- 1.6 g (CV 46.1\%) and in snack 0.3 +/- 0.4 g (CV 163.3\%). NaCl content per 100 kcal of breakfast was 0.4 +/- 0.1 g (CV 29.5\%), dinner 0.7 +/- 0.2 g (CV 27.8\%) and snack 0.13 +/- 0.19 g (CV 145.8\%). The difference of NaCl content among meals was statistically significant (p {$<$} 0.01)., CONCLUSION: Children in kindergarten, through three meals, received NaCl in a quantity that exceeded internationally established population nutrient goal for daily salt intake. The main source of NaCl was dinner, a meal that is cooked at place.},

However, there is limited evidence on how interventions function in the real world to achieve sustained population-wide salt reduction. Process evaluations are crucial for understanding how and why an intervention resulted in its observed effect in that setting, particularly for complex interventions. This project presents the detailed protocol for a process evaluation of a statewide strategy to lower salt intake in Victoria, Australia. We describe the pragmatic methods used to collect and analyse data on six process evaluation dimensions: reach, dose or adoption, fidelity, effectiveness, context and cost, informed by Linnan and Steckler's framework and RE-AIM. Data collection methods include routinely collected administrative data; surveys of processed foods, the population, food industry and organizations; targeted campaign evaluation and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data will be triangulated to provide validation or context for one another. This process evaluation will contribute new knowledge about what components of the intervention are important to salt reduction strategies and how the interventions cause reduced salt intake, to inform the transferability of the program to other Australian states and territories. This protocol can be adapted for other population-based, complex, disease prevention interventions.},

  abstract = {We aimed to verify the effect of new low-sodium high-potassium seasonings and processed foods containing poly-gamma-glutamic acid on blood pressure in free-living settings. To this end, we conducted a randomized, double-blind controlled trial on 187 Japanese men, aged 35-67 years, who did not use antihypertensives. Participants were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 93) or a control group (n = 94). They were given a boxed lunch and miso soup (average Na and K content for the intervention group: 1175 and 1476 mg; for the control group: 2243 and 703 mg, respectively). Blood pressure was measured three times every morning for 1 week immediately before and during the final week of the trial. On the day before and the final day of the intervention period, 24 h urine samples were collected. After intervention, the intervention group showed a significantly stronger decrease in the urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio than the control group (p {$<$} 0.001). The mean difference in systolic blood pressure change after adjustment for baseline values between the two groups was -2.1 (95\% CI: -3.6, -0.6) mmHg. Compliance between the groups was similar, suggesting successful blinding. In conclusion, the use of new seasonings and processed foods aimed at lowering blood pressure in free-living settings may be feasible and effective.},

High blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for the development of CVD and blood pressure levels are strongly associated with salt intake. Worldwide, salt consumptions accounts more than two fold the recommended daily intake, which has been described to be associated with CVD and some cancers. Benefits of decrease salt intake (reduction of morbidity, mortality and health related costs) have promoted several public health strategies to reduce salt consumption globally. Among the most commonly used strategies include educational campaigns and the gradual decrease of added salt in processed foods. Chile has joined these initiatives with an agreement between the producers of bread and the Ministry of Health to gradually decrease the concentration of salt in bread nationwide. The purpose of this review is to provide updated information regarding recommended intakes of salt, real intake, adverse effects of excess consumption, profits attributable to a decline and analyze the global strategies to reduce salt intake in the population.},

Venous blood was drawn upon admission to the labor and delivery unit. Pre-eclamptic patients received standard magnesium sulfate therapy and had a second sample of venous blood drawn 4 h following the beginning of therapy. Fetal umbilical vein blood was obtained immediately following delivery in both groups. Osmolality was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer. Electrolyte levels were measured with a NOVA 8 biomedical analyzer. Data were analyzed via Student's t test, linear regression and correlation with significance established at p {$<$} 0.05., RESULTS: We found no significant difference between the maternal osmolalities of the control and pre-eclamptic groups. Interestingly, fetal cord blood osmolality was significantly lower than maternal osmolality in the normal pregnant women. Sodium levels were also lower, while potassium and ionized calcium levels were higher in the fetal blood. In women with pre-eclampsia treated with magnesium sulfate, there was no difference between the osmolality of the maternal and fetal blood, while potassium and ionized calcium levels were still higher in the fetal blood. Finally, we found no correlation between maternal osmolality and blood pressure., CONCLUSIONS: High blood pressure in pre-eclampsia is not associated with altered osmolality. An absence of the normal decrease in fetal osmolality is observed in pre-eclamptic women treated with magnesium sulfate.},

The average household sodium intake is two times higher than the World Health Organization recommendation. The consumption of processed foods is an important and growing contributor to sodium intake. The objective of this study was to describe the sodium content of packaged foods (mg/100 g) sold in Costa Rica in 2015 (n = 1158) and 2018 (n = 1016) and to assess their compliance with the national sodium reduction targets. All 6 categories with national targets were analyzed: condiments, cookies and biscuits, bread products, processed meats, bakery products, and sauces. A significant reduction in mean sodium content was found in only 3 of the 19 subcategories (cakes, tomato-based sauces, and tomato paste). No subcategories had statistically significant increases in mean sodium levels, but seasonings for sides/mains, ham, and sausage categories were at least 15\% higher in sodium. Compliance with the national sodium targets among all foods increased from 80\% in 2015 to 87\% in 2018. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to reduce the sodium content in packaged foods in Costa Rica, but more work is needed to continually support a gradual reduction of sodium in packaged foods, including more stringent sodium targets.},

For most individuals, the molecular basis of hypertension remains unknown. In some hypertensive persons, a postprandial natriuretic response, normally elicited by a salty meal, is diminished and contributes to body sodium accumulation and plasma volume expansion. An important physiological mechanism ensuring the increased salt excretion following ingestion of salt is based on a luminocrine and endocrine secretion of novel small intestinal peptides--guanylins. Membrane guanylate cyclase receptors mediate effects of these peptides that provide a novel link between the intestine and kidney by means of circulating molecular guanylin forms. It can be expected that the emergence of the novel guanylin signaling pathways will energize search for molecular defects causing hypertension.},

However, evidence was largely based on the general population. Here we summarized the latest evidence supporting lifestyle intervention in chronic kidney disease., RECENT FINDINGS: Both observational cohort studies as well as randomized controlled trials have demonstrated health benefits with more physical activity in chronic kidney disease. There are compelling observational data supporting different health and kidney benefits with a healthy dietary pattern rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, plant-based foods and low in salt, low in sugar, saturated fat, red meat and ultraprocessed foods, a plant-based diet or Mediterranean diet in chronic kidney disease population. Clinical and epidemiologic studies also showed that higher 24 h urine potassium excretion (as proxy of higher dietary potassium intake) may be associated with lower blood pressure, better kidney outcomes and lower mortality in chronic kidney disease population. Randomized controlled trials also suggested that salt substitutes improved blood pressure control, reduced all-cause death and cardiovascular event risk in the general population compared with regular salt., SUMMARY: Accumulating evidence supports the current recommendation of encouraging physical activity and promoting a healthy dietary pattern in chronic kidney disease patients. Whether potassium needs restriction in chronic kidney disease diet requires further review. The safety versus benefits of salt substitutes in patients with moderate and advanced chronic kidney disease warrants further investigation. Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: In June 2016, South Africa implemented legislation mandating maximum sodium levels in a range of processed foods with a goal of reducing population salt intake and disease burden from hypertension. Our aim was to explore the relationship between salt and blood pressure (BP) in a subsample of the World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 2 before implementation of legislation in South Africa., METHODS \& RESULTS: Blood pressure (BP) was measured in triplicate (n = 2722; median age 56 years; 33\% male) and 24-h urine collected in a nested subsample (n = 526) for sodium, potassium and creatinine analysis. Hypertension prevalence was 55\% in older adults (50-plus years) and 28\% in younger adults (18-49 years). Median salt intake (6.8 g/day) was higher in younger than older adults (8.6 g vs 6.1 g/day; p {$<$} 0.001), and in urban compared to rural populations (7.0 g vs 6.0 g/day; p = 0.033). Overall, 69\% of participants had salt intakes above 5 g/day. Potassium intakes were generally low (median 35 mmol/day) with significantly lower intakes in rural areas and older adults. Overall, 91\% of adults failed to meet the daily potassium recommendation of 90 mmol/d. Salt intakes above 5 g/day, and to a greater extent, a dietary sodium-to-potassium (Na:K) ratio above 2 mmol/mmol, were associated with significantly steeper regression slopes of BP with age., CONCLUSION: These preliminary results indicate that high dietary Na:K ratio may lead to a greater increase in BP and hypertension risk with age. Interventions to increase potassium intakes alongside sodium reduction initiatives may be warranted.

  abstract = {Potassium was identified as a shortfall nutrient by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 Advisory Committee. The committee concluded that there was a moderate body of evidence of the association between potassium intake and blood pressure reduction in adults, which in turn influences the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease. Evidence is also accumulating of the protective effect of adequate dietary potassium on age-related bone loss and reduction of kidney stones. These benefits depend on organic anions associated with potassium as occurs in foods such as fruits and vegetables, in contrast to similar blood pressure-lowering benefits of potassium chloride. Benefits to blood pressure and bone health may occur at levels below current recommendations for potassium intake, especially from diet, but dose-response trials are needed to confirm this. Nevertheless, intakes considerably above current levels are needed for optimal health, and studies evaluating small increases in fruit and vegetable intake on bone and heart outcomes for short periods have had disappointing results. In modern societies, Western diets have led to a decrease in potassium intake with reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables with a concomitant increase in sodium consumption through increased consumption of processed foods. Consumption of white vegetables is associated with decreased risk of stroke, possibly related to their high potassium content. Potatoes are the highest source of dietary potassium, but the addition of salt should be limited. Low potassium-to-sodium intake ratios are more strongly related to cardiovascular disease risk than either nutrient alone. This relationship deserves further attention for multiple target tissue endpoints.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To describe sodium-related knowledge and self-reported behaviors in adults with hypertension and assess the association between knowledge and behaviors and blood pressure levels in this population. METHODS Using convenience sampling of patients with hypertension, an oral cross-sectional survey was administered by student pharmacists in 45 community pharmacies in Alabama and Florida in May to July 2012. After survey questions were administered, patients' blood pressures were measured. Data were tested for significance at alpha {$<$} 0.05 using bivariate analyses of independent and dependent variables (systolic/diastolic blood pressure [SBP/DBP]) and parallel linear regression of significant independent variables. RESULTS The majority of the 664 patients surveyed were women (59.3\%) and white (75.2\%). Most resided in urban areas (81.5\%). The mean SBP/DBP was 133.3 (SD = 15.7)/81.7 (SD = 9.1) mg Hg. Most participants recognized the relationship between salt intake and high blood pressure (91.1\%) and stroke (78.0\%). A small percentage of patients reported that they always look for sodium content on food products (15.0\%) and always buy low-sodium products (10.6\%). Patients with lower knowledge scores (B = -0.01, P {$<$} 0.001) and those who were advised to cut down on salt (B = 0.02, P = 0.037) had higher SBP levels when controlled for gender, race, and awareness of their blood pressure goals. In regression analysis, lower knowledge scores were associated with increased DBP levels (B = -0.52, P = 0.014) when controlled for gender and race. CONCLUSION Many patients were not aware of salt in processed food and did not always look for sodium content on nutritional labels. Pharmacists should address dietary salt when interacting with patients with hypertension.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: National and international agencies recommend a reduction in dietary sodium intake. However, some have questioned the wisdom of these policies. The goal of this report was to assess the findings and quality of studies that have examined the relationship between dietary sodium and both blood pressure and cardiovascular disease., METHODS: Literature review of the available observational studies and randomized controlled trials, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses., RESULTS: A large body of evidence from observational studies and clinical trials documents a direct relationship between dietary sodium intake and the level of blood pressure, especially in persons with a higher level of blood pressure, African-Americans, and those who are older or have comorbidity, including chronic kidney disease. A majority of the available observational reports support the presence of a direct relationship between dietary sodium intake and cardiovascular disease but the quality of the evidence according to most studies is poor. The limited information available from clinical trials is consistent with a beneficial effect of reduced sodium intake on incidence of cardiovascular disease., CONCLUSIONS: The scientific underpinning for policies to reduce the usual intake of dietary sodium is strong. In the United States and many other countries, addition of sodium during food processing has led to a very high average intake of dietary sodium, with almost everyone exceeding the recommended goals. National programs utilizing voluntary and mandatory approaches have resulted in a successful reduction in sodium intake. Even a small reduction in sodium consumption is likely to yield sizable improvement in population health. Copyright © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary risks today constitute the largest proportion of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally and in Sweden. An increasing number of people today consume highly processed foods high in saturated fat, refined sugar and salt and low in dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals. It is important that dietary trends over time are monitored to predict changes in disease risk., METHODS: In total, 15,995 individuals with two visits 10 (+/-1) years apart in the population-based Vasterbotten Intervention Programme 1996-2014 were included. Dietary intake was captured with a 64-item food frequency questionnaire. Percent changes in intake of dietary components, Healthy Diet Score and Dietary Inflammatory Index were calculated and related to body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and blood pressure at the second visit in multivariable regression analyses., RESULTS: For both sexes, on group level, proportion of energy intake (E\%) from carbohydrates and sucrose decreased (largest carbohydrate decrease among 40 year-olds) and E\% protein and total fat as well as saturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) increased (highest protein increase among 30 year-olds and highest fat increase among 60 year-olds) over the 10-year period. Also, E\% trans-fatty acids decreased. On individual basis, for both sexes decreases in intake of cholesterol and trans-fatty acids were associated with lower BMI and serum cholesterol at second visit (all P {$<$} 0.05). For men, increases in intake of whole grain and Healthy Diet Score were associated with lower BMI and serum cholesterol at second visit (all P {$<$} 0.05). Also for men, decreases in intake of trans-fatty acids and increases in Healthy Diet Score were associated with lower systolic blood pressure at second visit (P = 0.002 and P {$<$} 0.000). For women, increases in intake of PUFA and Healthy Diet Score were associated with lower BMI at second visit (P = 0.01 and P {$<$} 0.05). Surprisingly, increases in intake of sucrose among women were associated with lower BMI at second visit (P = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based sample, dietary changes over 10 years towards less carbohydrates and more protein and fat were noted. Individual changes towards the Nordic dietary recommendations were associated with healthier cardio-metabolic risk factor profile at second visit.},
