abstract = {To (i) estimate the consumption of minimally processed, processed and ultra-processed foods in a sample of Lebanese adults; (ii) explore patterns of intakes of these food groups; and (iii) investigate the association of the derived patterns with cardiometabolic risk.
Cross-sectional survey. Data collection included dietary assessment using an FFQ and biochemical, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Food items were categorized into twenty-five groups based on the NOVA food classification. The contribution of each food group to total energy intake (TEI) was estimated. Patterns of intakes of these food groups were examined using exploratory factor analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations of derived patterns with cardiometabolic risk factors.
Greater Beirut area, Lebanon.
Adults ≥18 years (n 302) with no prior history of chronic diseases.
Of TEI, 36·53 and 27·10 % were contributed by ultra-processed and minimally processed foods, respectively. Two dietary patterns were identified: the 'ultra-processed' and the 'minimally processed/processed'. The 'ultra-processed' consisted mainly of fast foods, snacks, meat, nuts, sweets and liquor, while the 'minimally processed/processed' consisted mostly of fruits, vegetables, legumes, breads, cheeses, sugar and fats. Participants in the highest quartile of the 'minimally processed/processed' pattern had significantly lower odds for metabolic syndrome (OR=0·18, 95 % CI 0·04, 0·77), hyperglycaemia (OR=0·25, 95 % CI 0·07, 0·98) and low HDL cholesterol (OR=0·17, 95 % CI 0·05, 0·60).
The study findings may be used for the development of evidence-based interventions aimed at encouraging the consumption of minimally processed foods.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate energetic contribution according to the degree of industrial food processing and its association with sociodemographic, anthropometric, biochemical, clinical and behavioural characteristics in adolescents. Design: Cross-sectional study (Adolescent Lifestyle Study). Food consumption was assessed using 24-h dietary recalls, with foods classified by degree of industrial progressing. The usual diet was estimated using the Multiple Source Method. In a linear regression model, the energy percentage (E %) was associated with sociodemographic, anthropometric, biochemical, clinical and behavioural characteristics, after adjustment for sex and age. Setting: Juiz de Fora, Brazil. Participants: Eight hundred and four adolescents, of both sexes, 14-19 years of age, enrolled in public schools. Results: The E % of unprocessed or minimally processed foods corresponded to 43 center dot 1 %, processed foods to 11 center dot 0 % and the ultraprocessed foods to 45 center dot 9 %. E % of unprocessed foods was associated with socio-economic stratum (adjusted beta = -0 center dot 093; P = 0 center dot 032), neck circumference (adjusted beta = 0 center dot 017; P = 0 center dot 049), screen time (adjusted beta = -0 center dot 247; P = 0 center dot 036) and HDL-cholesterol (adjusted beta = -0 center dot 156; P = 0 center dot 003). E % of ultraprocessed foods was associated with socio-economic stratum (adjusted beta = 0 center dot 118; P = 0 center dot 011), screen time (adjusted beta = 0 center dot 375; P = 0 center dot 003), BMI (adjusted beta = -0 center dot 029; P = 0 center dot 025), neck circumference (adjusted beta = -0 center dot 017; P = 0 center dot 028) and HDL-cholesterol (adjusted beta = 0 center dot 150; P = 0 center dot 002). Conclusions: There was a high E % of ultraprocessed foods in the diet of the adolescents. Actions are needed to raise the awareness of adopting healthy eating habits.},

abstract = {Objective To assess associations between three diet quality indices and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the Cree (Eeyouch) of northern Quebec, Canada, as well as to evaluate their pertinence in this Indigenous context.
Design The alternative-Healthy Eating Index 2010 (aHEI-2010), the Food Quality Score (FQS) and the contribution of ultra-processed products (UPP) to total daily dietary energy intake using the NOVA classification were calculated from 24 h food recalls. MetS was determined with the latest harmonized definition. Logistic regressions assessed the relationship between quintiles of dietary quality scores with MetS and its components.
Setting Study sample from the 2005-2009 cross-sectional Nituuchischaayihititaau Aschii Environment-and-Health Study.
Subjects Eeyouch (n 811) from seven James Bay communities (18 years old).
Results MetS prevalence was 566 % with 954 % abdominal adiposity, 501 % elevated fasting plasma glucose, 434 % hypertension, 386 % elevated TAG and 445 % reduced HDL cholesterol. Comparing highest and lowest quintiles of scores, adjusted OR (95 % CI) of MetS was 070 (039, 108; P-trend=005) for aHEI-2010, 106 (063, 176; P-trend=087) for FQS and 190 (114, 317; P-trend=004) for the contribution of UPP to total daily dietary energy intake.
Conclusions Although diet quality indices have been associated with cardiometabolic risk, only the dietary intake of UPP was significantly associated with MetS in the Eeyouch. Indices tailored to the food environment of northern communities are essential to further understand the impact of diet quality in this context.},

abstract = {Background & aims
High consumption of ultra‐processed food (UPF) is associated with mortality and chronic morbidity but has not been studied concerning to non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to test the association of UPF consumption with metabolic syndrome, NAFLD and related‐liver damage.
Methods
A cross‐sectional study among volunteers who underwent abdominal ultrasound (AUS), anthropometrics, blood pressure measurements, and fasting blood tests including FibroMax for non‐invasive assessment of NASH and significant fibrosis. A food‐frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate UPF consumption using the NOVA classification.
Results
A total of 789 subjects were included in the total sample (mean age 58.83 ± 6.58 years, 52.60% men), a reliable FibroMax test was obtained from 714 subjects, 305 subjects were diagnosed with NAFLD. High consumption of UPF was associated with higher odds for metabolic syndrome (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.31‐2.71, P = .001) and its components; hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL, among the entire sample (OR = 1.53, 1.07‐2.19, P = .026; OR = 1.51, 1.08‐2.11, P = .017; OR = 1.55, 1.05‐2.29, P = .028). In addition, it was associated with higher odds for NASH and hypertension (OR = 1.89, 1.07‐3.38, P = .030; OR = 2.26, 1.20‐4.26, P = .012 respectively) among subjects with NAFLD. Stratification by smoking status revealed an association between high UPF consumption and significant fibrosis among ever smokers in the entire sample and among subjects with NAFLD (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.03‐3.45, P = .039; OR = 2.85, 1.14‐7.14, P = .026 respectively).
Conclusions
High UPF consumption is associated with metabolic syndrome in the general population, and among those with NAFLD it is associated with NASH marker. Ever‐smoking may act synergistically with UPF to amplify the risk for fibrosis.},

abstract = {•Recommendations to reduce population-level consumption of ultra-processed foods should be maintained and the population must be encouraged to this food intake.•There were mixed results in almost every component, except for total cholesterol, where a positive relationship was described in all articles in which it was analyzed.•Different variables such as physical activity can modify the effect of ultra-processed food consumption on body fat and metabolic syndrome components; thus studies must account for it.
The aim of this study was to thoroughly review the scientific literature related to cohort studies that evaluated the association between the intake of ultra-processed foods, according to the NOVA classification, and the increase in the components of metabolic syndrome and body fat in children and adolescents.
We consulted the PubMed, Scielo, Lilacs, and ScienceDirect databases and selected cohort studies that met the main objective of this review and included the age group of interest. We used an adaptation of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to evaluate cohort studies.
Of 383 articles identified, 367 were excluded after reading the title, abstract, and methodology. Only nine met the selection criteria defined for this review. Of the nine articles, two reported a positive association between high consumption of ultra-processed foods and total cholesterol levels; one reported a positive association with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, one with triacylglycerols, one with diastolic blood pressure, three with body mass index, two with waist circumference, and two with body fat.
Seven of nine studies found at least one association with components of metabolic syndrome. This highlights the importance of early intervention to prevent non-communicable diseases in the future.},

abstract = {Population studies have demonstrated an association between sodium and potassium intake and blood pressure levels and lipids. The aim of this study was to describe the dietary intake and contribution of sodium and potassium to the Mexican diet, and to describe its association with nutrition status and clinical characteristics. We analyzed a national survey with 4219 participants. Dietary information was obtained with a 24-h recall. Foods and beverages were classified according to level of processing. The mean intake (mg/d) of Na was 1512 in preschool children, 2844 in school-age children, 3743 in adolescents, and 3132 in adults. The mean intake (mg/d) of K was 1616 in preschool children, 2256 in school-age children, 2967 in adolescents, and 3401 in adults. Processed and ultra-processed foods (UPF) contribute 49% of Na intake in preschool children, 50% in school-age children, 47% in adolescents, and 39% in adults. Adults with high Na intake had lower serum concentrations of cholesterol, HDL-c, and LDL-c. A significant proportion of the Mexican population has a high intake of Na (64-82%) and low K (58-73%). Strategies to reduce Na and increase K intake need to reduce the possibility of having high BP and serum lipid disturbances.},

abstract = {The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasing and the relationship between ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption and MetS remains uncertain in Chinese adults. This study aimed to examine the longitudinal association of UPF consumption with the risk of MetS and its components in Chinese adults. Adults aged 18 years and above who participated in at least two waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) in 2009, 2015, and 2018 were included in this analysis. Dietary intake data were collected by three consecutive 24 h dietary recalls and weighing household foods and condiments. Depending on the purpose and extent of food processing, UPFs were classified using the NOVA food classification system. A multivariate Cox proportional risk model was used to explore the association between UPF consumption (grouped by quartile: quartile 1 (Q1), quartile 2 (Q2), quartile 3 (Q3), and quartile 4 (Q4)) and risk of MetS and its components. A total of 5147 adults were included. During a median (IQR) 6.0 (3.0, 9.0) year follow-up with 31,878 person-years, 1712 MetS cases were identified, with an incidence of 33.26%. After multivariable adjustment, the risk of MetS was increased by 17% in the highest quartile with UPF consumption (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01-1.35, p trend: 0.047), with the lowest quartile as a reference. For the components of MetS, the risk of central obesity, raised triglycerides (TG), reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and raised blood pressure (BP) was increased by 33% (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.18-1.51, p trend: <0.001), 26% (HR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.48, p trend: 0.003), 25% (HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.07-1.46, p trend: 0.007), and 16% (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.03-1.32, p trend: 0.018) in the highest quartile with UPF consumption, respectively. Adults aged 45-59 years and living in urban areas with higher UPF consumption had higher odds of MetS. These results indicate that higher long-term UPF consumption was associated with an increased risk of MetS in Chinese adults. Further studies such as intervention trials are needed to confirm the mechanism of correlation between UPF consumption and health-related outcomes. Nutritional education actions are warranted to promote a balanced diet and improve the overall dietary quality of residents to reduce the risk of MetS effectively.},

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of UPF consumption on the incidence of MetS and its components in adults. A prospective study was conducted with 896 participants from the 1978/79 Ribeirão Preto cohort, São Paulo, Brazil. UPF consumption was evaluated in %kcal and %g at ages 23–25 years. Incidence of MetS and its components were estimated at ages 37–39 years, according to the Joint Interim Statement criteria. Poisson regression was used to assess associations, and interactions with sex were investigated. UPF consumption had no association with MetS (%kcal Adjusted PR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.99–1.01; %g Adjusted PR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.99–1.01). However, women with higher UPF consumption, in %kcal and %g, had a higher risk of abdominal obesity (%kcal: p = 0.030; %g: p = 0.003); and women with higher UPF consumption, in %g, had a higher risk of low HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.041). For the other components of MetS, no significant associations were observed in either sex. These findings suggest evidence of no association between UPF consumption and MetS; however, consumption of UPF was associated with increased WC and low HDL-c, but only in women.},

abstract = {Objective To examine associations of urinary phthalate levels with blood pressure (BP) and serum triglyceride and lipoprotein levels in children. Study design We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a subsample of US children aged 6-19 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2003 and 2008. We quantified exposure to 3 families of phthalates—low molecular weight, high molecular weight and di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP)—based on molar concentration of urinary metabolites. We assessed descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate associations with BP and lipid levels. Results Controlling for an array of sociodemographic and behavioral factors, as well as diet and body mass index, levels of metabolites of DEHP, a phthalate commonly found in processed foods, were associated with higher age-, sex-, and height-standardized BP. For each log unit (roughly 3-fold) increase in DEHP metabolites, a 0.041 SD unit increase in systolic BP z -score was identified ( P = .047). Metabolites of low molecular weight phthalates commonly found in cosmetics and personal care products were not associated with BP. Phthalate metabolites were not associated with triglyceride levels, high-density lipoprotein level, or prehypertension. Conclusions Dietary phthalate exposure is associated with higher systolic BP in children and adolescents. Further work is needed to confirm these associations, as well as to evaluate opportunities for intervention.},

The aim of this study was to identify dietary patterns (DPs) and analyze their association with cardiovascular risk factors including metabolic biomarkers and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in a cross-sectional population-based study with 959 Brazilian adults from Viçosa.
Food consumption was assessed by food frequency questionnaire, and DPs were identified by principal component analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was applied to assess sociodemographic and behavioral variables.
Four distinct DPs were identified: Western, Snacks and Processed Food, Healthy, and Traditional Brazilian. Comparing the highest to the lowest tertile of each DP: Snacks and Processed Food DP was associated with a significantly higher diastolic blood pressure (β = 2.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48–5.14), waist circumference (β = 4.75; 95% CI, 2.77–6.73), body mass index (β = 1.65; 95% CI, 0.63–2.67), neck circumference (β = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.15–1.34), uric acid (β = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13–0.51), and C-reactive protein (β = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.07–0.55). The Healthy DP was associated with lower Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR; β = −0.17; 95% CI, −0.34 to −0.008), lower tumor necrosis factor-α (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26–0.84), lower interleukin (IL)-8 (OR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28–0.91), and lower catalase (OR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16–0.78). The Traditional Brazilian DP was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (β = −5.04; 95% CI, −7.60 to −2.48), non-HDL cholesterol (β: −10.25; 95% CI, −19.07 to −1.43), and superoxide dismutase (OR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32–0.87), and higher uric acid (β = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.01–0.48), IL-12p70 (OR = 2.55; 95% CI, 1.23–5.32), IL-1β (OR = 2.22; 95% CI, 1.01–4.89), IL-10 (OR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.05–3.93), and ferric reducing ability of plasma (OR = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.16–4.27).
The Snacks and Processed Food DP was associated with increases in several risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and the Healthy DP with lower HOMA-IR scores, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-8, and catalase. A diet based on rice and beans (Traditional Brazilian) may have a protective role against non-HDL cholesterol while presenting other risks related to inflammation and oxidative stress, as shown by a direct association with the interleukins IL-12p70, IL-1β, and IL-10 and an inverse association with superoxide dismutase.},

abstract = {Starch is one of the major sources of carbohydrates (CHO) contributing to about 50–70% of the daily energy intake in human diet. Processed foods contribute to an important part of daily energy intake, especially in occidental countries. During food processing, starch undergoes dramatic changes when heated in the presence of water or high pressure. The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of controlling food processes on starch digestibility profile in cereal-based foods and the interest of preserving starch in its native, slowly digestible, form on in vivo metabolic fate. Four different food processes were evaluated: extrusion, dry bread, soft cake and rotary-moulded biscuit. The resulting differences in gelatinization of each product translated to different SDS levels. Imaging techniques (X-ray diffraction, microtomography and electronic microscopy) were used to investigate the changes in SDS structure obtained through the different food processes. For in vivo evaluation, 12 healthy subjects were recruited and consumed a portion of 50 g of available CHOs of each product, in a crossover design. Glycemic and insulin responses were evaluated over 120 minutes in postprandial period. We showed that rotary molding technology preserved starch in its intact form and provided the highest SDS content (28g/100g) when the three other technologies (dried bread, soft cake and extrusion) led to SDS content below 3g/100 g. In addition, the lowest SDS contents are explained by a higher level of starch structure disruption which translated in a shift from crystalline structure into amorphous one. These data were linked to in vivo results. The global analysis for GI indicated that a significant difference existed among the foods’ mean GI values (p < 0.0001). Rotary product showed the lowest GI values. The soft, the dried bread had medium GI and extruded product had the highest GI with 77. The global analysis for II indicated that a significant difference existed among the foods’ mean II values (p < 0.0001), with the same order as for GI values. In addition, a portion of rotary-molded biscuit decreased significantly the glycemic peak by 1 mM compared to the 3 other products. Decrease of postprandial glycemia is a meaningful target in the prevention of metabolic diseases. This can be achieved through the modification of dietary factors such as starch digestibility.},

There is an increase in the prevalence of overweight and high consumption of ultra-processed foods in parallel with patterns of traditional meals that include beans. This study analyzed associations between bean consumption in the diet of adolescents and nutrition outcomes. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant reduction in body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (%BF) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) values among those with bean consumption equal to or greater than five times a week. Adolescents who had lunch outside the home and those who did not have the habit of having lunch showed a significantly higher BMI. There was an increase in the %BF among married adolescents and those who did not have lunch. There was a reduction of LDL-c among those with intermediate per capita income and those who consumed processed juice less than 5 times a week, and an increase among those who did not have breakfast. There were significant interactions between sexual maturation, energy consumption, physical activity and energy consumption. Thus, in the context of this study, the presence of beans in the diet, at frequencies equal to or greater than five times a week, can be considered a proxy for healthy eating.},

This cross-sectional study with 232 children and adolescents with CHD identified the prevalence and patterns of the breakfast, described these according to sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle characteristics, and assessed their association with cardiometabolic and nutritional markers. Breakfast patterns were identified by principal components, and bivariate and linear regression analysis were applied. Breakfast consumption was observed in 73% of participants. Four BP were identified: pattern 1 "milk, ultra-processed bread, and chocolate milk", pattern 2 "margarine and processed bread", pattern 3 "cold meats/sausages, cheeses and butter/cream" and pattern 4 "fruits/fruit juices, breakfast cereals, yogurts, and homemade cakes/pies and sweet snacks". Family history for obesity and acyanotic CHD were associated with breakfast skipping. Younger participants and greater maternal education were associated with greater adherence to pattern 1 and pattern 4. Older participants and longer post-operative time showed greater adherence to pattern 3. No association between skipping breakfast or BP and cardiometabolic and nutritional markers was observed. Nonetheless, the findings reinforce the need for nutritional guidance for healthy breakfast, aiming to reduce the consumption of ultra-processed foods and to prioritize fresh and minimally processed foods.},

abstract = {The Western diet is high in dietary phosphorus, partially due to added phosphorus, (i.e., phosphates) predominantly present in processed food products. Elevated serum phosphate levels, otherwise known as hyperphosphatemia, have been associated with changes in health status, of note detrimental effects on cardiovascular and renal health. However, the extent to which highly absorbed added phosphorus contributes to these changes is relatively unknown, due to its poor characterization among food composition databases. Industry-provided data on phosphorus source ingredients and ranges of added phosphorus present in food categories to enable a more accurate estimation of the total, added, and natural phosphorus intakes in the U.S. population. Using regression analyses, we then assessed relationships between estimated total, added, and natural phosphorus intakes on biomarkers of health status and mortality in individuals enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994 and 2001-2016 datasets. Total, added, and natural phosphorus intakes were associated with several biomarkers of health status. Added phosphorus intake was consistently inversely associated with HDL cholesterol in both men and women, whereas naturally occurring phosphorus intake was inversely correlated with the risk of elevated blood pressure. However, in most cases, the predicted impact of increases in phosphorus intake would result in small percentage changes in biomarkers. No meaningful associations between phosphorus and mortality were found, but indications of a correlation between mortality with quintiles of naturally occurring phosphorus were present, depending on covariate sets used. The disparate results for natural and added phosphorus intakes within the current study provide increased support for updating current food composition databases to more accurately account for dietary phosphorus intake as total, naturally occurring, and added phosphorus.},

abstract = {Cardiometabolic disorders are characterised by a cluster of interactive risk determinants such as increases in blood glucose, lipids and body weight, as well as elevated inflammation and oxidative stress and gut microbiome changes. These disorders are associated with onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). T2DM is strongly associated with CVD. Dietary advanced glycation end products (dAGEs) attributable from modern diets high in sugar and/or fat, highly processed foods and high heat-treated foods can contribute to metabolic etiologies of cardiometabolic disorders. This mini review aims to determine whether blood dAGEs levels and tissue dAGEs levels are determinants of the prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders through recent human studies. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for blood dAGEs measurement and skin auto fluorescence (SAF) for skin AGEs measurement can be used. Recent human studies support that a diet high in AGEs can negatively influence glucose control, body weight, blood lipid levels and vascular health through the elevated oxidative stress, inflammation, blood pressure and endothelial dysfunction compared with a diet low in AGEs. Limited human studies suggested a diet high in AGEs could negatively alter gut microbiota. SAF could be considered as one of the predictors affecting risks for cardiometabolic disorders. More intervention studies are needed to determine how dAGEs are associated with the prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders through gut microbiota changes. Further human studies are conducted to find the association between CVD events, CVD mortality and total mortality through SAF measurement, and a consensus on whether tissue dAGEs act as a predictor of CVD is required.},

abstract = {Most evidence on the relationship between sodium and potassium intake and cardiovascular disease originated from general population studies. This study aimed to evaluate the relation between estimated 24-hour sodium and potassium urinary excretion and the risk of recurrent vascular events and mortality in patients with vascular disease.
7561 patients with vascular disease enrolled in the UCC-SMART cohort (1996-2015) were included. Twenty-four hour sodium and potassium urinary excretion were estimated (Kawasaki formulae) from morning urine samples. Cox proportional hazard models with restricted cubic splines were used to evaluate the relation between estimated urinary salt excretion and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality) and all-cause mortality.
After a median follow-up of 7.4 years (interquartile range: 4.1-11.0), the relations between estimated 24-hour sodium urinary excretion and outcomes were J-shaped with nadirs of 4.59 gram/day for recurrent MACE and 4.97 gram/day for all-cause mortality. The relation between sodium-to-potassium excretion ratio and outcomes were also J-shaped with nadirs of 2.71 for recurrent MACE and 2.60 for all-cause mortality. Higher potassium urinary excretion was related to an increased risk of both recurrent MACE (HR 1.25 per gram potassium excretion per day; 95%CI 1.13-1.39) and all cause-mortality (HR 1.13 per gram potassium excretion per day; 95%CI 1.03-1.25).
In patients with established vascular disease, lower and higher sodium intake were associated with higher risk of recurrent MACE and all-cause mortality. Higher estimated 24-hour potassium urinary excretion was associated with a higher risk of recurrent MACE and all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Introduction
Cardiometabolic risk factors often emerge in childhood, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. The school environments represent an important active space in a child's routine and may influence their health status.
Methods
In this cross‐sectional study, we aimed to evaluate the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors and its association with the obesogenic and leptogenic environment around schools. A total of 378 children (181 boys; 197 girls) aged 8 and 9 years, enrolled in all urban schools of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, were evaluated. Concentrations of high‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (HDL‐c) and triglycerides (TG), and the insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), waist circumference (WC), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured. The neighborhood income, walkability index, predominantly ultra‐processed food stores, public spaces for leisure and/or physical activities, traffic accidents, crime and green spaces densities were assessed in 400 road network buffers around schools. To test association of the obesogenic and leptogenic environment around schools with cardiometabolic risk clustering, binary logistic regression models were performed with generalized estimating equations.
Results
“Obesogenic school environments” had greater densities of ultra‐processed food stores, crime and traffic accidents, and higher walkability. The “↓ Atherogenic risk” cluster consisted of higher HDL‐c values. There was an inverse association between the obesogenic environment around schools and a child's “↓ atherogenic risk” clustering (OR = 0.63; p < 0.001).
Conclusion
We concluded that public policies aimed at modifying the environment around schools, by providing healthier food options and safe conditions for active mobility, are essential to prevent child's atherogenic risk.},

This research aimed to analyze the association between dietary pattern and changes in cardiovascular risk factors among postmenopausal Taiwanese women using binary logistic regression. This cross-sectional study involved 5689 postmenopausal Taiwanese women aged 45 years and above, and the data were obtained from Mei Jau Health Management Institution database between 2001 and 2015. The cardiovascular risk dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of processed food, rice/flour products, organ meat, and sauce was derived by reduced rank regression. Participants in the highest quartile of the cardiovascular risk dietary pattern were more likely to have high levels of systolic blood pressure (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.08–1.53), diastolic blood pressure (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.01–1.62), atherogenic index of plasma (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06–1.49), triglycerides (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.17–1.62), and fasting blood glucose (Q3: OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07–1.97). However, this dietary pattern was not correlated with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein. Therefore, adherence to the cardiovascular risk dietary pattern increases the risk of having higher levels of blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose in postmenopausal Taiwanese women.},

abstract = {Unhealthy dietary intake is an important preventable risk factor for obesity and impaired blood glucose (IBG), ultimately increasing the risk of non-communicable diseases. When compared to individual food intakes, dietary patterns are a stronger predictor of health outcomes and should be systematically evaluated where such evidence is lacking. This study evaluated dietary patterns and their association with the risk of central obesity and IBG among adults.
A community-based survey was conducted among 501 randomly-selected adults from Eastern Ethiopia. Data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire during a face-to-face interview that included sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, as well as a validated 89-item food frequency questionnaire (collected over one month). Principal component analysis was used to derive the dietary pattern. While central obesity was assessed using waist and/or hip circumference measurements, fasting blood sugar was used for IBG. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted with an odds ratio, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values reported.
A total of 501 adults (95.3%) were interviewed, with a mean age of 41 years (±12). Five major dietary patterns explaining 71% of the total variance were identified: "nutrient-dense foods", "high fat and protein", "processed foods", "alcohol drinks", and "cereal diets". While 20.4% (17.0-24.2%) had IBG, 14.6% (11.8-17.9) were centrally obese, and 94.6% (92.3-96.3) had an increased waist-to-hip circumference ratio. Central obesity is associated with upper wealth status (AOR = 6.92; 2.91-16.5), physical inactivity (AOR = 21.1; 2.77-161.4), a diet high in nutrient-dense foods (AOR = 1.75; 0.75-4.06), processed foods (AOR = 1.41; 0.57-3.48), and cereal diets (AOR = 4.06; 1.87-8.82). The burden of IBG was associated with upper wealth status (AOR = 2.36; 1.36-4.10), physical inactivity (AOR = 2.17; 0.91-5.18), upper tercile of nutrient-dense foods (AOR = 1.35; 0.62-2.93), fat and protein diet (AOR = 1.31; 0.66-2.62), and cereal diet consumption (AOR = 3.87; 1.66-9.02).
IBG and central obesity were prevalent and predicted by upper tercile consumption of nutrient-dense foods, high fat and protein diets, processed foods, and cereal diets, which could guide dietary interventions.},

abstract = {There is little information about how diet influences the health of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) survivors. This study explores the associations between diet quality indices, cardiometabolic health indicators and inflammatory biomarkers among cALL survivors. Participants were part of the PETALE study (
= 241, median age: 21.7 years). Adherence to 6 dietary scores and caloric intake from ultra-processed foods were calculated. Multivariate logistirac regressions, Student
-tests and Mann-Whitney tests were performed. We found that 88% of adults and 46% of children adhered poorly to the Mediterranean diet, 36.9% had poor adherence to the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations and 76.3% had a diet to be improved according to the HEI-2015 score. On average, ultra-processed foods accounted for 51% of total energy intake. Low HDL-C was associated with a more inflammatory diet (E-DIITM score) and higher intake of ultra-processed foods. A greater E-DII score was associated with elevated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and consumption of ultra-processed foods was correlated with high triglycerides. Circulating levels of TNF-α, adiponectin and IL-6 were influenced by diet quality indices, while CRP and leptin were not. In conclusion, survivors of cALL have poor adherence to dietary recommendations, adversely affecting their cardiometabolic health.},

abstract = {Fish consumption may have beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome (MetS); however, limited information of such associations exists. This study investigated possible associations between fish consumption and changes in MetS components during a 13-year follow-up period.
The sample included participants (26-69 years) from the Tromsø Study 4 (1994-1995,
= 23,907) and Tromsø Study 6 (2007-2008,
= 12,981). Data were collected using questionnaires including food frequency questions, non-fasting blood samples, and physical examinations. MetS was defined using the Joint Interim Societies (JIS) definition, in which one point was given for each MetS criteria fulfilled (metabolic score). Longitudinal analyses were performed using Linear mixed models.
For both genders, lean fish consumption once a week or more was significantly associated with decreased future metabolic score, decreased triglycerides, and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, whereas decreased waist circumference and blood pressure was identified only for men (age adjusted models). Fatty fish consumption was significantly associated with increased waist circumference for both genders and increased HDL-cholesterol levels in men.
: The results suggest that fatty and lean fish consumption may influence MetS differently and that lean fish consumption in particular seems to be associated with beneficial changes in the MetS components.},

abstract = {There is very limited knowledge on the magnitude to which foods with low nutritive value constitute the diet of adults from the province of Quebec. The extent to which these foods impact cardiometabolic risk is also poorly documented. The objective was to assess the contribution of low nutritive value foods to total energy intake (E) and to examine associations with cardiometabolic risk factors among French-speaking adults from 5 administrative regions of the Province of Quebec.
As part of the cross-sectional PREDISE Study, 1147 adults (50.2% women; mean [SD] age, 43.2 [4.6] years) participated in a web-based investigation. Dietary intake data were obtained using a validated web-based self-administered 24-h recall, the R24W, completed on three occasions. Foods with low nutritive value were defined as foods exceeding predetermined thresholds for the following nutrients: saturated fat, sugar or sodium as well as beverages and ingredients not recommended in Canada's Food Guide 2019. A total of 1019 participants underwent on-site clinical assessment of cardiometabolic risk factors.
Participants consumed on average 29.0%E (95%CI, 28.2-29.7) as low nutritive value foods, to which pastries (18%), alcohol (15%), sweets (13%), chips/popcorn (6%) and sugar-sweetened beverages (6%) contributed the most. Low nutritive value foods contributed more to total E in men than in women (30.7%E vs. 27.5%E, respectively; P < 0.0001). In fully-adjusted linear regression models, increments of 250 kcal/d from low nutritive value foods were associated with higher body mass index (+ 1.7 kg/m
; 95%CI 1.2 to 2.2), higher waist circumference (+ 0.6 cm; 95%CI, 0.1 to 1.1), cholesterol: HDL cholesterol ratio (+ 0.12 mmol/L; 95%CI, 0.01 to 0.24 and triglycerides (+ 7.8%; 95%CI, 3.0 to 12.8).
Low nutritive value foods contribute near 30% of total daily energy intake of French-speaking adults of the Province of Quebec and are associated with increased waist circumference and an unfavourable lipid profile. Addressing consumption of low nutritive value foods at the population level is a potential strategy to attenuate the burden of chronic diseases.},

Animal by-products are valuable protein sources in animal nutrition. Among them are blood products and blood meal, which are used as high-quality material for their beneficial effects on growth and health. Within the framework of the feed ban relaxation, the development of complementary methods in order to refine the identification of processed animal proteins remains challenging. The aim of this study was to identify specific biomarkers that would allow the detection of bovine blood products and processed animal proteins using tandem mass spectrometry. Seventeen biomarkers were identified: nine peptides for bovine plasma powder; seven peptides for bovine haemoglobin powder, including six peptides for bovine blood meal; and one peptide for porcine blood. They were not detected in several commercial compound feed or feed materials, such as blood by-products of other animal origins, milk-derived products and fish meal. These biomarkers could be used for developing a species-specific and blood-specific detection method.},

abstract = {Circulating aldosterone levels are increased in human pregnancy. Inadequately low aldosterone levels as present in preeclampsia, a life-threatening disease for both mother and child, are discussed to be involved in its pathogenesis or severity. Moreover, inactivating polymorphisms in the aldosterone synthase gene have been detected in preeclamptic women. Here, we used aldosterone synthase-deficient (AS
−/−
) mice to test whether the absence of aldosterone is sufficient to impair pregnancy or even to cause preeclampsia. AS
−/−
and AS
+/+
females were mated with AS
+/+
and AS
−/−
males, respectively, always generating AS
+/−
offspring. With maternal aldosterone deficiency in AS
−/−
mice, systolic blood pressure was low before and further reduced during pregnancy with no increase in proteinuria. Yet, AS
−/−
had smaller litters due to loss of fetuses as indicated by a high number of necrotic placentas with massive lymphocyte infiltrations at gestational day 18. Surviving fetuses and their placentas from AS
−/−
females were smaller. High-salt diet before and during pregnancy increased systolic blood pressure only before pregnancy in both genotypes and abolished the difference in blood pressure during late pregnancy. Litter size from AS
−/−
was slightly improved and the differences in placental and fetal weights between AS
+/+
and AS
−/−
mothers disappeared. Overall, an increased placental efficiency was observed in both groups paralleled by a normalization of elevated HIF1α levels in the AS
−/−
placentas. Our results demonstrate that aldosterone deficiency has profound adverse effects on placental function. High dietary salt intake improved placental function. In this animal model, aldosterone deficiency did not cause preeclampsia.},

abstract = {SCOPE: High‐salt intake is a major risk factor in the development of hypertension. The underlying mechanism of high sodium on the cardiovascular system has received extensive attention. TRPP2 (Polycystin‐2) is a Ca²⁺permeable nonselective cation channel that mediates Ca²⁺mobilization to control vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contraction. Here, we investigated TRPP2 expression change in VSMCs from high‐salt intake hypertensive rats and role of TRPP2 in the development of high‐salt diet‐induced hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: After 4 ws of dietary treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated in high‐salt intake rats (132 ± 3 mmHg) compared with regular diet control rats (104 ± 2 mmHg). Results from vessel tension and diameter measurements show that high‐salt intake potentiated phenylephrine‐induced contraction in denuded mesenteric artery and thoracic aorta. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence data indicate that TRPP2 expression in VSMCs from mesenteric artery and thoracic aorta was significantly increased in high‐salt intake‐induced hypertensive rats. However, agonist‐induced contractions in denuded mesenteric artery and thoracic aorta were markedly decreased if TRPP2 was knocked down by specific shRNA. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that high‐salt intake increased TRPP2 expression in VSMCs, which in turn potentiated blood vessel response to contractors; this may participate in the development of hypertension.},

abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Obesity and unhealthy dietary habits are described as risk factors for NAFLD. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the consumption of different animal protein sources and hepatic status in NAFLD adults. A total of 112 overweight/obese participants with NAFLD from Fatty Liver in Obesity (FLiO) study were evaluated at baseline. Diet, body composition, and biochemical variables were evaluated. Hepatic status was also assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, ultrasonography, and elastography. Red meat consumption showed a positive relationship with liver iron content (r = 0.224;
= 0.021) and ferritin concentration (r = 0.196;
= 0.037). Processed meat consumption exhibited a positive association with liver iron content (r = 0.308;
= 0.001), which was also found in the quantile regression (β = 0.079;

abstract = {Garlic protects against degenerative diseases such as hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. However, raw garlic has a strong pungency, which is unpleasant. In this study, we examined the effect of high temperature/high pressure-processed garlic on plasma lipid profiles in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal control diet, a high cholesterol (0.5% cholesterol) diet (HCD) only, or a high cholesterol diet supplemented with 0.5% high temperature/high pressure-processed garlic (HCP) or raw garlic (HCR) for 10 weeks. The body weights of the rats fed the garlic-supplemented diets decreased, mostly because of reduced fat pad weights. Plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) in the HCP and HCR groups decreased significantly compared with those in the HCD group. Additionally, fecal TC and TG increased significantly in the HCP and HCR groups. It is notable that no significant differences in plasma or fecal lipid profiles were observed between the HCP and HCR groups. High temperature/high pressure-processed garlic contained a higher amount of S-allyl cysteine than raw garlic (P<.05). The results suggest that high temperature/high pressure-processed garlic may be useful as a functional food to improve lipid profiles.},

abstract = {Background Nitrates and nitrites are used as food additives in processed meats. They are also commonly ingested from water and several foods. Several short-term clinical studies suggested beneficial effects of dietary nitrates on blood pressure, while deleterious effects on oxidative damage have been suggested in some experimental studies. However, there is a lack of evidence from longitudinal epidemiological studies linking foods and water-originated and additives-originated nitrites and nitrates, separately, to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases risk. We aimed to study these associations in a large population-based cohort. Methods and Results Overall, 106 288 adults from the French NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2022) were included. Associations between nitrites and nitrates intakes and hypertension and cardiovascular disease risks were assessed using multi-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. During follow-up, 3810 incident cases of hypertension and 2075 cases of cardiovascular diseases were ascertained. Participants with higher intakes of additives-originated nitrites (sodium nitrite in particular [European code e250]) had a higher hypertension risk compared with nonconsumers (hazard ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.08-1.32],
=0.001, and 1.19 [95% CI, 1.08-1.32],
=0.002), respectively. No association was detected between foods and water-originated nitrites, or nitrates with hypertension risk (all
values >0.3). We found no association between nitrites or nitrates and risks of cardiovascular diseases (all
values >0.2). Conclusions These results do not support a protective role of nitrites or nitrates in cardiovascular health. Instead, they suggest a positive association between nitrites from food additives and hypertension risk, which needs confirmation in other large-scale studies. These findings provide new evidence in the context of current discussions about updating regulations on the use of nitrites as food additives.},

abstract = {Vitamin K is a generic term for several fat-soluble molecules found in natural and processed foods, playing an important role in human health for blood coagulation and bone metabolism. Although vegetable oils contain only phylloquinone (vitamin K1), milk and infant formula contain not only a phylloquinone but also menaquinone-4 (vitamin K2), which has a polarity more similar to that of triglyceride and impurities, therefore requiring silica gel column chromatography before HPLC analysis can be performed. By focusing on silica gel particle size to reduce the required quantity of silica gel and organic solvent, we have reported an efficient analytical procedure for quantification of phylloquinone and menaquinone-4. However, the procedure left room for improvement in terms of the on-duty-hours required for manual pretreatment by the operator. Accordingly, we have now developed a more time-efficient analytical procedure using an automated solid phase extraction system, which frees the operator from the time required for manual chromatography pretreatment. Furthermore, by examining more closely the conditions required for this system, we have developed a better procedure capable of reducing the required quantity of silica gel and organic solvent for vitamin K analysis in milk, powdered infant formula, liquid infant formula and plant oils, thus making it more ecofriendly.},

abstract = {Extrusion is a widely used food processing technology. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of extruded adzuki bean convenient food (EABCF) on glycemic and inflammation control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.
In a randomized controlled trial, 120 T2DM patients were randomly assigned to a control diet group (the low glycemic index [LGI] group, assigned the traditional diabetic low glycemic index diet) or an intervention group (the EABCF group, assigned daily consumption of EABCF). Diet information and blood samples were collected at baseline and after a 4-week intervention. After excluding exogenous insulin users, a subgroup analysis based on baseline fasting insulin (FINS) levels was conducted, and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) was the target indicator.
A total of 106 patients completed the trial, and 89 participants were included in the subgroup analysis. After the intervention, glycemic control improved in both groups compared to baseline, but the difference was not statistically significant (
>0.05). However, the EABCF group showed decreased inflammation with significantly lower tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) level compared to the control group (adjusted
<0.01). There was also a slight increase in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in the EABCF group (adjusted
=0.004). Moreover, the subgroup analysis found that, after 4 weeks, a diet consisting of EABCF increased insulin secretion to normal levels in the group with hypoinsulinism (baseline FINS<5.2 mU/L). However, the difference only showed a trend toward statistical significance (0.05<
=0.079<0.1).
EABCF had a similar hypoglycemic effect as the traditional diabetic LGI diet and showed a greater inhibitory effect on inflammation in T2DM patients. However, further clinical studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanism.},

abstract = {► We investigated transglutaminase polymerisation of brown rice proteins in the flour and in the isolated protein fractions. ► Glutelin complexes polymerise into new supramolecular structures, while albumins and globulins are only slightly affected. ► The major glutelin subunits are primary substrates for the cross-linking reaction. ► The newly formed supramolecular complexes are the result of covalent bonds as well as strong hydrophobic interactions. ► The newly formed complexes and interactions explain in molecular terms the improved textural quality of brown rice breads.
Recently, it was shown that transglutaminase (TGase) treatment of brown rice (BR) flour results in textural improvements of gluten-free bread. In this study, changes in the protein profiles of BR flour and protein fractions induced by TGase treatment were investigated to better understand the activity and specificity of the enzyme. Size-exclusion HPLC (SE-HPLC) profiles of flour extracts, under reducing conditions, revealed the presence of macromolecular protein complexes, as well as low molecular weight proteins. After TGase treatments (10U/g of proteins) a general reduction in peak intensities indicated the polymerisation of BR proteins into larger, insoluble complexes. Microchip capillary electrophoresis and two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis revealed that the α and β glutelin subunits were primary substrates for the polymerisation reaction, whereas albumins and globulins were only slightly affected. SE-HPLC of the protein fractions revealed glutelins’ polymerisation into high molecular weight structures after TGase treatment. Dynamic light scattering measurements showed that new supramolecular aggregates of glutelins co-existed with the macromolecular complexes already present in the untreated fraction. Front-face fluorescence approaches indicated that TGase treatment caused a decrease in protein surface hydrophobicity of BR flour, but not of the glutelin suspensions. It is concluded that the large protein complexes resulting from glutelin polymerisation and the stronger hydrophobic interactions among proteins result in the improved textural properties of TGase-treated BR bread.},

abstract = {Increased dietary linoleic acid has been associated with reduced blood pressure in clinical and animal studies possibly mediated by prostaglandins. Urinary linoleate and prostaglandin metabolite excretion were investigated in subjects exposed to a salt-loading/salt-depletion regimen. Twelve healthy subjects were recruited from the New Orleans population (before Hurricaine Katrina) and admitted to the Tulane-Louisiana State University-Charity Hospital General Clinical Research Center after a 5-day outpatient lead-in phase on a 160-mmol sodium diet. On inpatient day 1, the subjects were maintained on the 160-mmol sodium diet, and a 24-hour urine specimen was collected. On day 2, the subjects received 2 L of IV normal saline over 4 hours and continued on a 160-mmol Na+ diet (total: 460 mmol of sodium). Two 12-hour urine collections were obtained. On day 3, the subjects received three 40-mg oral doses of furosemide, two 12-hour urine collections were obtained, and the subjects were given a 10-mmol sodium diet. Urinary oxidized lipids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectroscopy. The excretion of the urinary linoleate metabolites, dihydroxyoctadecamonoenoic acids, and trihydroxyoctadecamonoenoic acids increased significantly during intravenous salt loading as compared with day 1 and the salt-depleted periods. The urinary excretion of 6-keto- prostaglandin F1 was unaffected by salt loading but was dramatically increased 7- to 10-fold by salt depletion. Prostaglandin E2 excretion was positively correlated with sodium excretion. The salt-stimulated production of linoleic acid diols and triols may inhibit tubular sodium reabsorption, thereby assisting in the excretion of the sodium load.},

abstract = {Radiotelemetry was used to evaluate diet-related elevation of blood pressure in adult Yucatan miniature swine. Systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP), diastolic atrial blood pressure (DAP), heart rate, and locomotor activity were assessed in 9- or 11-mo-old Yucatan miniature pigs fed
a standard diet or a North American-type diet high in salt, fat, and sugar (HSFS). Compared with pigs fed standard diet, pigs fed HSFS diet showed markedly elevated SAP (132 ± 3 compared with 156 ± 6 mm Hg), whereas DAP was unchanged (92 ± 2 compared with 99 ± 5
mm Hg). In addition, all pigs were modestly sensitive to short-term changes in dietary salt, as indicated by a 6% to 7% response in blood pressure parameters. According to these data, the increase in SAP for pigs on the HSFS diet was too large to be explained by the NaCl content of the diet
alone. We found no evidence of endothelial dysfunction, and the relaxation responses of isolated coronary arteries actually were enhanced in the HSFS group. In conclusion, in a Yucatan miniature pigs model chronically fed a HSFS diet, DAP did not increase, but SAP and pulse pressure appeared
to be affected by high dietary levels of fat or sugar (or both).},

The extraction and separation of vitamins were achieved based on an ion‐pair formation approach between these ionizable analytes and 1‐heptanesulfonic acid sodium salt as an ion‐pairing agent. Influential variables on the ion‐pair cloud‐point extraction efficiency, such as the ion‐pairing agent concentration, ionic strength, pH, volume of Triton X‐100, extraction temperature, and incubation time have been fully evaluated and optimized. Water‐soluble vitamins were successfully extracted by 1‐heptanesulfonic acid sodium salt (0.2% w/v) as ion‐pairing agent with Triton X‐100 (4% w/v) as surfactant phase at 50°C for 10 min. The calibration curves showed good linearity (r² > 0.9916) and precision in the concentration ranges of 1‐50 μg/mL for thiamine and niacinamide, 5–100 μg/mL for pyridoxine, and 0.5–20 μg/mL for riboflavin.

Oral administration of drugs to laboratory animals such as mice typically is achieved through gavage, in which a feeding needle is introduced into the esophagus and the drug is delivered directly into the stomach.
This method requires technical skill, is stressful for animals, and introduces risk of injury, pain and morbidity. Here we investigated another method of drug administration. The benzimidazole derivative albendazole was emulsified in commercially available honey and administered to mice by
voluntary feeding or gavage. Mice that received albendazole by either gavage or honey ingestion had virtually identical levels of serum albendazole sulfoxide, indicating that uptake and metabolism of albendazole was similar for both administration techniques. In addition, dosing mice with
the albendazole-honey mixture for 8 wk had antiparasitic activity comparable to earlier studies using gavage for drug administration. Compared with gavage, voluntary ingestion of a drug in honey is more rapid, less stressful to the animal, and less technically demanding for the administrator.
Because of its low cost and ready availability, honey presents a viable vehicle for drug delivery.},

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of T-Rib supplementation on the hepatic antioxidant system in rat models of diet-induced obesity and taurine deficiency. To induce taurine deficiency, β-alanine was administered by dissolving it in drinking water (3 % w/v). Fifty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats (4-week-old) were randomly divided into the following seven groups with eight rats in each group for 6 weeks: N group, normal diet; HF group, high-fat diet; HFT group, high-fat diet and 4 mmol/kg/day taurine; HFA group, high-fat diet and β-alanine; HFR2 group, high-fat diet, β-alanine, and 2 mmol/kg/day T-Rib; HFR4 group, high-fat diet, β-alanine, and 4 mmol/kg/day T-Rib; and HFR6 group, high-fat diet, β-alanine, and 6 mmol/kg/day T-Rib. Taurine and T-Rib were orally administered to the HFT and HFR groups, respectively. To investigate the effect of T-Rib on the hepatic antioxidant system, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activities were analyzed. In addition, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) content, glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the liver were analyzed. Serum GOT levels, hepatic TBARS content, and GPx activities in the HFT and HFR groups significantly improved compared to the corresponding values in the HF and HFA groups. These results suggest that supplementation with T-Rib as well as with taurine could be beneficial to the hepatic antioxidant system in rat models of diet-induced obesity and taurine deficiency. Further study is needed to investigate the mechanism of T-Rib action.},

N-(β-d-Xylopyranosyl)taurine sodium salt is a newly synthesized compound with taurine and xylose. β-alanine was administered for induction of taurine depletion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups with eight rats per group and fed for 6 weeks. Body weight gain and epididymal adipocyte size were significantly lower in HFTX2, 4, 6 (high-fat diet + 3 % β-alanine + T-Xyl 2, 4, 6 mmol/kg/day) groups compared to HF (high-fat diet) and HFA (high-fat diet + 3 % β-alanine) groups. Body weight (BW) and size of adipocytes in the HF and HFA groups increased significantly compared to the N (normal diet) group. The final BW, weight of relative epididymal fat (E-fat), and adipocyte size of the HF group were significantly higher, compared to that in the N group; however, administration of T-Xyl appeared to result in a decrease in those. The HA group showed a significant increase in serum total cholesterol (TC) level and calculated atherogenic index (AI) compared to the N group; however, administration of taurine and T-Xyl tended to result in a decrease in TC and AI. These results suggest that T-Xyl supplementation shows anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects in rats fed a high-fat diet and β-alanine and may be absorbed through another transporter instead of a taurine transporter. Further study is needed in order to clarify the mechanism of T-Xyl action.},

abstract = {Abstract Estrogen deficiency worsens ischemic stroke outcomes. In ovariectomized (OVX+ ) rats fed a high-salt diet (HSD), an increase in the body Na+ /water ratio, which characterizes water-free Na+ accumulation, was associated with detrimental vascular effects independent of the blood pressure (BP). We hypothesized that an increase in brain water-free Na+ accumulation is associated with ischemic brain damage in OVX+ /HSD rats. To test our hypothesis we divided female Wistar rats into 4 groups, OVX+ and OVX− rats fed HSD or a normal diet (ND), and subjected them to transient cerebral ischemia. The brain Na+ /water ratio was increased even in OVX+ /ND rats and augmented in OVX+ /HSD rats. The increase in the brain Na+ /water ratio was positively correlated with expansion of the cortical infarct volume without affecting the BP. Interestingly, OVX+ was associated with the decreased expression of ATP1α3, a subtype of the Na+ efflux pump. HSD increased the expression of brain Na+ influx-related molecules and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The pretreatment of OVX+ /HSD rats with the MR antagonist eplerenone reduced brain water-free Na+ accumulation, up-regulated ATP1α3, down-regulated MR, and reduced the cortical infarct volume. Our findings show that the increase in the brain Na+ /water ratio elicited by estrogen deficiency or HSD is associated with ischemic brain damage BP-independently, suggesting the importance of regulating the accumulation of brain water-free Na+ . The up-regulation of ATP1α3 and the down-regulation of MR may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to attenuate ischemic brain damage in postmenopausal women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Marinobufagenin (MBG) is an endogenous Na/K-ATPase inhibitor, a natriuretic and a vasoconstrictor. MBG is implicated in salt-sensitive hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and initiate the pro-fibrotic signaling. Previously it was demonstrated that immunoneutralization of an endogenous MBG by 3E9 anti-MBG-antibody (mAb) in vivo lowered blood pressure (BP) and reversed cardiac fibrosis in salt-sensitive, and in partially nephrectomized rats. In the present study, we investigated whether mAb alleviates vascular remodeling induced in normotensive rats on high salt intake.
METHODS
Wistar rats (5 months old) received normal (CTRL; n = 8) or high salt intake (2% NaCl in drinking water) for 4 weeks ( n = 16). Rats from the group on a high salt intake were administered vehicle (SALT; n = 8) or mAb (50 µg/kg) (SALT-AB; n = 8) during the last week of high salt diet. BP, erythrocyte Na/K-ATPase activity, levels of MBG in plasma and 24-hour urine, and sensitivity of aortic explants to the vasorelaxant effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were measured. Aortic collagen abundance was determined immunohistochemically.
RESULTS
In SALT vs. CTRL, heightened levels of MBG were associated with inhibition of erythrocyte Na/K-ATPase in the absence of BP changes. High salt intake was accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase in aortic collagen abundance and by a reduction of sensitivity of aortic explants to the vasorelaxant effect of SNP following endothelin-1-induced constriction. In the SALT-AB group, all NaCl-mediated effects were reversed by immunoneutralization of MBG.
CONCLUSIONS
High salt intake in young normotensive rats can induce vascular fibrosis via pressure-independent/MBG-dependent mechanisms, and this remodeling is reduced by immunoneutralization of MBG.},

abstract = {The effects of glutathione (GSH) and glutathionesulfonic acid sodium salt [N-(N-γ-L-glutamyl-L-β-sulfoalanyl)glycine sodium salt, GSO3Na], which is a minor metabolite of GSH, on the pharmacokinetics of thiopental sodium were investigated in rats. The concomitant use of GSO3Na with thiopental sodium significantly increased the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio (Kp) of thiopental sodium 60 min after its administration in the heart, lung, brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, while GSH did not affect them. On the other hand, the Kp value of thiopental sodium 5 min after its administration with concomitant GSO3Na decreased significantly only in the spleen. Neither GSO3Na nor GSH changes the pharmacokinetic parameters of thiopental sodium. Significant change of the binding ratio of thiopental sodium to bovine serum albumin (BSA) was not observed by the addition of less than 5-fold GSO3Na. About 50% of thiopental sodium was bound to the brain, lung or liver, however, no significant change of this binding ratio was observed by the concomitant use of GSO3Na. The partition coefficient of thiopental sodium apparently increased by the concomitant use of GSO3Na but not by GSH. This phenomenon seemed to be concerned with a mechanism to increase the Kp values of thiopental sodium in the tissues. The increment in the drug distribution to tissues with concomitant GSO3Na observed in this study is useful information for the application of drug combinations as a biodistribution promoter.},

abstract = {Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition of intermittent nocturnal upper airway obstruction. OSA increases sympathetic drive which may result in clinical and biochemical features suggestive of pheochromocytoma. We present the case of a 65-year-old male with a 2.9-cm left adrenal incidentaloma on CT, hypertension, symptoms of headache, anxiety and diaphoresis, and persistently elevated 24-h urine norepinephrine (initially 818 nmol/day (89–470)) and normetanephrine (initially 11.2 µmol/day (0.6–2.7)). He was started on prazosin and underwent left adrenalectomy. Pathology revealed an adrenal corticoadenoma with no evidence of pheochromocytoma. Over the next 2 years, urine norepinephrine and normetanephrine remained significantly elevated with no MIBG avid disease. Years later, he was diagnosed with severe OSA and treated with continuous positive airway pressure. Urine testing done once OSA was well controlled revealed complete normalization of urine norepinephrine and normetanephrine with substantial symptom improvement. It was concluded that the patient never had a pheochromocytoma but rather an adrenal adenoma with biochemistry and symptoms suggestive of pheochromocytoma due to untreated severe OSA. Pseudo-pheochromocytoma is a rare presentation of OSA and should be considered on the differential of elevated urine catecholamines and metanephrines in the right clinical setting. Learning points Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition among adults. OSA may rarely present as pseudo-pheochromocytoma with symptoms of pallor, palpitations, perspiration, headache, or anxiety. OSA should be considered on the differential of elevated urine catecholamines and metanephrines, especially in patients with negative metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan results.},

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have investigated that Na or K intakes might be associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, little evidence has evaluated the association between Na:K ratio and the MetS. In this study, we assessed the association between the dietary Na:K ratio and the MetS. The cross-sectional study was conducted among adults aged 18 years and older in Nanjing, using a multi-stage random sampling method, which resulted in a sample size of 1993 participants. Dietary Na and K intakes were assessed by 3 consecutive days of dietary recollection combined with condiments weighing method. Health-related data were obtained by standardised questionnaires, as well as physical examinations and laboratory assessments. The prevalence rate of the MetS was 36·5 % (728/1993). After adjusting for various lifestyle and dietary factors of the MetS, participants in the highest quartile of dietary Na:K ratio were at a higher risk of developing MetS (OR=1·602; 95 % CI 1·090, 2·353) compared with those in the lowest quartile. Each 1-sd increase in dietary Na:K ratio was associated with a higher risk of prevalent MetS (OR=1·166; 95 % CI: 1·018, 1·336). Among the components of the MetS, dietary Na:K ratio was positively associated with high blood pressure (quartile 3 v. quartile 1: OR=1·656; 95 % CI 1·228, 2·256) and hypertriacylglycerolaemia (quartile 4 v. quartile1: OR=1·305; 95 % CI 1·029, 1·655) in multivariate analysis. These results revealed that higher dietary Na:K ratio significantly increased the risk of the MetS in Chinese adults. Further studies are needed to verify this association.},

abstract = {Summary
Dietary sodium intake has been associated with progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) as well as hypertension. A high‐salt intake causes renal damage independent of hypertension. Because traditional renal biomarkers are insensitive, it is difficult to detect renal injury induced by a high‐salt intake, especially in normotensive patients. Here, we investigated whether newly developed renal biomarkers could be detected earlier than traditional biomarkers under a high‐salt intake, in normotensive rats. Male Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) received a regular (0.8% NaCl) or salt‐loaded (2, 4, and 8% NaCl) diet from 9 to 17 weeks of age. A urine sample was obtained once a week and urinary vanin‐1, neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin (NGAL), and kidney injury molecule‐1 (Kim‐1) were measured. At 17 weeks of age, 8% salt‐loaded WKY showed histopathological renal tubular damage and elevated Rac1 activity in renal tissues. Although there was no significant increase in serum creatinine, urinary albumin, N‐acetyl‐β‐D‐glucosaminidase (NAG), or Kim‐1 during the study period among the groups, urinary vanin‐1 and NGAL significantly increased in 8% salt‐loaded WKY from 10 to 17 weeks of age. These results suggest that urinary vanin‐1 and NGAL, which might be induced by salt per se, are potentially earlier biomarkers for renal tubular damage in normotensive rats under a high‐salt intake.},

abstract = {To evaluate the effects of a low-sodium and high-potassium salt-substitute on lowering blood pressure (BP) among Tibetans living at high altitude (4300 meters).
The study was a patient-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted between February and May 2009 in Dangxiong County, Tibetan Autonomous Region, China. A total of 282 Tibetans aged 40 or older with known hypertension (systolic BP≥140 mmHg) were recruited and randomized to intervention (salt-substitute, 65% sodium chloride, 25% potassium chloride and 10% magnesium sulfate) or control (100% sodium chloride) in a 1: 1 allocation ratio with three months' supply. Primary outcome was defined as the change in BP levels measured from baseline to followed-up with an automated sphygmomanometer. Per protocol (PP) and intention to treat (ITT) analyses were conducted.
After the three months' intervention period, the net reduction in SBP/DBP in the intervention group in comparison to the control group was -8.2/-3.4 mmHg (all p<0.05) in PP analysis, after adjusting for baseline BP and other variables. ITT analysis showed the net reduction in SBP/DBP at -7.6/-3.5 mmHg with multiple imputations (all p<0.05). Furthermore, the whole distribution of blood pressure showed an overall decline in SBP/DBP and the proportion of patients with BP under control (SBP/DBP<140 mmHg) was significantly higher in salt-substitute group in comparison to the regular salt group (19.2% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.027).

abstract = {Objectives: We aimed to assess whether a 7-day high-salt (HS) diet affects endothelium-dependent and/or endothelium-independent microvascular function in the absence of changes in arterial blood pressure (BP), and to determine whether such microvascular changes are associated with changes in body composition and fluid status in healthy young humans. Materials and Methods: Fifty-three young healthy individuals (28 women and 25 men) were assigned to a 7-day low-salt diet (<3.5 g salt/day) followed by a 7-day HS diet (∼14 g salt/day). Skin microvascular blood flow in response to iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry, and BP, heart rate (HR), plasma renin activity (PRA), serum aldosterone, serum and 24 h-urine sodium, potassium, urea and creatinine levels, together with body composition and fluid status measurement with a 4-terminal portable impedance analyzer were measured before and after diet protocols. Results: BP, HR, body composition and fluid status were unchanged, and PRA and serum aldosterone level were significantly suppressed after HS diet. ACh-induced dilation (AChID) was significantly impaired, while SNP-induced dilation was not affected by HS diet. Impaired AChID and increased salt intake, as well as impaired AChID and suppressed renin-angiotensin system were significantly positively correlated. Changes in body composition and fluid status parameters were not associated with impaired AChID. Conclusion: 7-day HS diet impairs microvascular reactivity by affecting its endothelium-dependent vasodilation in young healthy individuals. Changes are independent of BP, body composition changes or fluid retention, but are the consequences of the unique effect of HS on endothelial function.},

abstract = {•H2S in the PVN attenuates sympathetic activity and hypertensive response.•H2S in the PVN decreases BP by weakening oxidative stress or PICs.•Increased H2S level in the PVN modestly maybe a therapeutic agent for hypertension.
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important gaseous signaling molecule in neuro-modulation, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-hypertensive effects. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is a major integrative nucleus in regulating BP and SNA. The aim of this study is to explore whether endogenous or exogenous H2S changed by hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HA) or GYY4137 infused in the PVN affects RSNA and MAP by regulating oxidative stress or the balance between pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) and anti-inflammatory cytokines in high salt-induced hypertensive rats. Male Dahl rats were fed by high-salt or normal-salt diet. At the end of the 4th week, GYY4137, HA or vehicle was microinjected into bilateral PVN for 6 weeks. The levels of MAP, HR, plasma norepinephrine (NE), reactive oxygen species (ROS), NOX2, NOX4 and IL-1β were increased significantly in high salt-induced hypertensive rats. Higher levels of these parameters were detected in the group treated by HA, but lower levels in the GYY4137 group. The trends of H2S, CBS, IL-10 and Cu/Zn SOD were opposite to the parameters described above. These findings suggest that endogenous or exogenous H2S in the PVN attenuates sympathetic activity and hypertensive response, which are partly due to decrease of ROS and PICs within the PVN in high salt-induced hypertension.},

abstract = {Essential hypertension is a multifactorial disease, which is affected by genetic and environmental factors, and can cause diseases such as cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, coronary heart disease, and chronic renal failure. High salt intake is a risk factor for hypertension, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure variability (BPV) is a reliable independent predictor of cardiovascular events and death. At present, there are few studies about the correlation among high salt intake, BPV, and target organ damage (TOD) in patients with hypertension.
The purpose of this study is to compare 24-hour urine sodium excretion, BPV, carotid intima-media thickness, left ventricular mass index, and serum creatinine or endogenous creatinine clearance rate. To clarify the relationship between high salt load and BPV and TOD in patients with hypertension.This study is a cross-sectional study. It will recruit 600 patients with essential hypertension in the outpatient and inpatient department of cardiovascular medicine of Chengdu Fifth People's Hospital. Researchers will obtain blood and urine samples with the patient's informed consent. In addition, we will measure patient's blood pressure and target organ-related information.
The study protocol was approved by the Chengdu Fifth People's Hospital. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical trial registry, ChiCTR2000029243. This trial will provide for the correlation among high salt intake, BPV, and TOD in patients with essential hypertension.},
