upf and na and bp relationship

Working area to contribute to project
The 3 R files analyse the data 
the first looks at Na and BP aswell as TEMJ and BP across 2 year groups of data

Te second takes a database of foods and applies it to the food diaries of the participants 
then a proportion of UPF intake is calculated 
finally this value is connected with the data fronm the first file (when it works)
to give results for omsysval ~upf  in 1-4 and in 9-11
as well as including sodium in multi regression models

The third file assess the cahnge in proportion of foods being defined as upf between 1-4 and 9-11
changing this significantly alters the upf calculations
