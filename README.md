upf and na and bp relationship

Nova is a classification system for food which moves away from nutritional analysis. 
Nutrition is included, but wider aspects of food are included in this system, which are not in nutrition only systems. 

Nova therefore is a system which acknowledges that food is not simply a collection of nutrients, but has other factors one of which is 'processing'



This is a working area to contribute to project
There is analysis of data 
one looks at Na and BP as well as TEMJ and BP across 2 year groups of data

A second takes a database of foods and applies it to the food diaries of the participants 
then a proportion of UPF intake is calculated 
finally this value is connected with the data fronm the first file (when it works)
to give results for omsysval ~upf  in 1-4 and in 9-11
as well as including sodium in multi regression models

A third file assess the change in proportion of foods being defined as upf between 1-4 and 9-11
changing this significantly alters the upf calculations
