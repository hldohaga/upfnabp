Qualitative study combining critical social theories, African American studies, and critical discourse concepts. Study participants consisted of a convenience sample (N = 30) of African American women (n = 15) and men (n = 15) with high blood pressure. Over a 4-month period in 1999 a community-based population sample was interviewed twice. Field experiences in the community and the assistance of community consultants were critical to data analysis. Based on 60 interviews, 191 passages about worry and 58 passages about stress were analyzed using discourse analysis. Participants not only distinguished between worry and stress in their everyday lives, but they also highlighted how those concepts were interrelated. Participants' concerns about themselves as well as their children, kin, and community were emphasized in passages about worry. Stress was primarily associated with doing multiple tasks and confronting multiple prejudices in the workplace and surrounding community. Participants perceived worry and stress as important health-related concepts that affected their high blood pressure. Nursing strategies designed to address these concerns may better facilitate holistic health.},

COVID‐19 mitigation strategies have unintended consequences on managing chronic conditions such as hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and health disparities in the United States. During the first wave of the pandemic in the United States, the combination of observed racial/ethnic inequities in COVID‐19 deaths and social unrest reinvigorated a national conversation about systemic racism in health care and society. The 4th Annual University of Utah Translational Hypertension Symposium gathered frontline clinicians, researchers, and leaders from diverse backgrounds to discuss the intersection of these 2 critical social and public health phenomena and to highlight preexisting disparities in hypertension treatment and control exacerbated by COVID‐19. The discussion underscored environmental and socioeconomic factors that are deeply embedded in US health care and research that impact inequities in hypertension. Structural racism plays a central role at both the health system and individual levels. At the same time, virtual healthcare platforms are being accelerated into widespread use by COVID‐19, which may widen the divide in healthcare access across levels of wealth, geography, and education. Blood pressure control rates are declining, especially among communities of color and those without health insurance or access to health care. Hypertension awareness, therapeutic lifestyle changes, and evidence‐based pharmacotherapy are essential. There is a need to improve the implementation of community‐based interventions and blood pressure self‐monitoring, which can help build patient trust and increase healthcare engagement.},

In this scenario, the use of communication technologies becomes appropriate for the monitoring of patients with AH. To preliminary verify the intervention approach and the effects of using an m-Health application on the health conditions of patients with AH for a future study, we conducted a non-randomized, controlled, non-blind trial (N = 39), comparing the use of a mobile health app (m-Health) with conventional AH monitoring over 3 months. During the study, we promoted health information workshops to engage patients from both intervention and control groups. Pre and post-intervention, we compared measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure; food frequency questionnaire; Appraisal of Self-Care Agency Scale; blood tests of hemogram, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, lipid profile, and glycemia. Improvements were identified in both groups due to the workshops, including the reduction in total and non-HDL cholesterol, healthier consumption of salads and sugary drinks, and increased self-care scores. Exclusively in the intervention group, which used the m-Health app, there was a change in systolic and diastolic pressure towards more adequate levels. In addition, the intervention group had improved levels of glucose and HDL cholesterol and reduced consumption of ultra-processed foods. In conclusion, the use of an m-Health app had positive effects on the health conditions of patients with AH under treatment within FHS, especially when combined with health information. On the context of FHS, the use of technology is encouraging supporting better health conditions.},

  abstract = {Background The benefits of blood pressure lowering treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease are well established. However, the extent to which these effects differ by baseline blood pressure, presence of comorbidities, or drug class is less clear. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify these differences. Method For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE for large-scale blood pressure lowering trials, published between Jan 1, 1966, and July 7, 2015, and we searched the medical literature to identify trials up to Nov 9, 2015. All randomised controlled trials of blood pressure lowering treatment were eligible for inclusion if they included a minimum of 1000 patient-years of follow-up in each study arm. No trials were excluded because of presence of baseline comorbidities, and trials of antihypertensive drugs for indications other than hypertension were eligible. We extracted summary-level data about study characteristics and the outcomes of major cardiovascular disease events, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. We used inverse variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool the estimates. Results We identified 123 studies with 613\hphantom{,}815 participants for the tabular meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses showed relative risk reductions proportional to the magnitude of the blood pressure reductions achieved. Every 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular disease events (relative risk [RR] 0·80, 95\% CI 0·77–0·83), coronary heart disease (0·83, 0·78–0·88), stroke (0·73, 0·68–0·77), and heart failure (0·72, 0·67–0·78), which, in the populations studied, led to a significant 13\% reduction in all-cause mortality (0·87, 0·84–0·91). However, the effect on renal failure was not significant (0·95, 0·84–1·07). Similar proportional risk reductions (per 10 mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure) were noted in trials with higher mean baseline systolic blood pressure and trials with lower mean baseline systolic blood pressure (all ptrend{$>$}0·05). There was no clear evidence that proportional risk reductions in major cardiovascular disease differed by baseline disease history, except for diabetes and chronic kidney disease, for which smaller, but significant, risk reductions were detected. β blockers were inferior to other drugs for the prevention of major cardiovascular disease events, stroke, and renal failure. Calcium channel blockers were superior to other drugs for the prevention of stroke. For the prevention of heart failure, calcium channel blockers were inferior and diuretics were superior to other drug classes. Risk of bias was judged to be low for 113 trials and unclear for 10 trials. Heterogeneity for outcomes was low to moderate; the I2 statistic for heterogeneity for major cardiovascular disease events was 41\%, for coronary heart disease 25\%, for stroke 26\%, for heart failure 37\%, for renal failure 28\%, and for all-cause mortality 35\%. Interpretation Blood pressure lowering significantly reduces vascular risk across various baseline blood pressure levels and comorbidities. Our results provide strong support for lowering blood pressure to systolic blood pressures less than 130 mm Hg and providing blood pressure lowering treatment to individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.

  abstract = {Trends in hypertension prevalence are difficult to assess because of a massive increase in the prevalence of antihypertensive treatment. Over the past three decades mean blood pressure levels among the 5209 members of the Framingham Study cohort have declined, and elevated blood pressure is only one third as prevalent. However, if those receiving treatment who have normalized blood pressures are defined as hypertensive, in addition to those with elevated blood pressure, the prevalence of hypertension has increased. No consistent secular trend in the incidence of hypertension was noted over three decades, but high blood pressure eventually developed in two thirds of the study cohort. To determine whether untreated blood pressure levels are changing over time, trends in mean blood pressure were examined in normotensive subjects over three decades. Only a 1 mm Hg decline in mean systolic and diastolic pressure over each 10-year interval was noted (p {$<$} 0.001). Thus blood pressure in the normotensive segment of the population has been quite stable. Because the incidence of hypertension is very high and future hypertension arises from the upper end of the normal blood pressure distribution, there is an urgent need for primary prevention. Preventive measures such as exercise, avoidance of salt and alcohol, and especially weight control deserve a high priority.},

Design~         The Syst-Eur study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, powered to detect differences in stroke rate between participants on active antihypertensive treatment and placebo. Systolic blood pressure variability measurements were made on 744 participants at the start of the trial. Systolic blood pressure variability was calculated over three time frames: 24 h, daytime and night-time. The placebo and active treatment subgroups were analysed separately using an intention-to-treat principle, adjusting for confounding factors using a multiple Cox regression model.         Participants~         An elderly hypertensive European population.         Main outcome measures~         Stroke, cardiac events (fatal and non-fatal heart failure, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and sudden death) and cardiovascular mortality (death attributed to stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, sudden death, pulmonary embolus, peripheral vascular disease and aortic dissection).         Results~         The risk of stroke increased by 80\% (95\% confidence interval: 17–176\%) for every 5 mmHg increase in night-time systolic blood pressure variability in the placebo group. Risk of cardiovascular mortality and cardiac events was not significantly altered. Daytime variability readings did not predict outcome. Antihypertensive treatment did not affect systolic blood pressure variability over the median 4.4-year follow-up.         Conclusion~         In the placebo group, but not the active treatment group, increased night-time systolic blood pressure variability on admission to the Syst-Eur trial was an independent risk factor for stroke during the trial.},

  abstract = {To date, Ontario public health units (PHUs) have generally neglected the social determinants of health (SDH) concept in favor of risk aversion and behaviorally oriented health promotion approaches. Addressing SDH and responding to the presence of health inequities is required under the Ontario Public Health Standards and is a component of provincial public health documents and reports. Nevertheless, units vary in their understanding and application of the SDH concept in their activities. The authors conducted 18 interviews with Medical Officers of Health and lead staff persons from nine Ontario PHUs, in order to better understand how these differences in addressing the SDH among health units come about. The findings suggest that differences in practice largely result from epistemological variations: conceptions of the SDH; the perceived role of public health in addressing them; and understandings concerning the validity of differing forms of evidence and expected outcomes. Drawing from Bachelard’s concept of epistemological barriers and Raphael’s seven discourses on the SDH, we examine the ways in which the participating units discuss and apply the SDH concepts. We argue that a substantial barrier to further action on the SDH is the internalization of discourses and traditions that treat health as individualized and depoliticized.},

This is significant, as uncertainty is associated with a variety of troublesome economic and clinical indicators. Researchers have identified the three types of cognitive resources needed to combat uncertainty (technical, personal, or conceptual), as well as the affective stress reactions physicians have when confronted with uncertainty. In this study, we explored the relationship between primary care physicians' stress reactions to uncertainty and the conceptual resource of epistemology. METHODS: Using Likert-type measures of epistemology and stress reactions to uncertainty, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with 78 board-certified and resident physicians in primary care. A simple bivariate regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between epistemology and stress reactions to uncertainty (Model 1), and a multivariate regression analysis was performed to test for the independent effect of epistemology on stress reactions to uncertainty while controlling for gender, specialty, and professional development status (Model 2). RESULTS: Physician epistemology and stress reactions to uncertainty were significantly related in both models. CONCLUSIONS: Among primary care physicians, a biopsychosocial epistemology is associated with less stress reactions to uncertainty, and a biomedical epistemology is associated with more stress reactions to uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Although we are increasingly reaping the benefits of qualitative studies, their approach and that of quantitative studies remain rather separate. Emergency medicine practitioners thrive off research in context as we deal with such an undifferentiated population however quantitative ’hard-science’ work is conspicuous for its absence of positionality. This contrasts strongly with the way in which qualitative research, within the domain of so-called soft-science literature, uses positionality as an integral element of the research process. Without contextualising the researcher and research environment in qualitative studies, often the meaning of any research output is lost. What follows is that positionality does not undermine the truth of such research, instead it defines the boundaries within which the research was produced. The absence of positionality when considered alongside the notion of bias, may challenge the quantitative idea of validity.},

  abstract = {An important goal of health promotion is to make it easier for people to make healthy choices. However, this may be difficult if people do not feel control over their environment and their personal circumstances. An important concept in relation to this is empowerment. Health professionals are expected to facilitate and enable people moving towards empowerment. In this paper, we address the question what is meant by individual empowerment. In an attempt to provide a theoretical framework, we discuss individual empowerment from a salutogenic perspective. This perspective introduces two fundamental concepts: the general resistance resources, and the sense of coherence. In addition, in order to further clarify and operationalise the concept, some factors influencing individual empowerment are identified, that is, locus of control, learned helplessness, self-efficacy and outcome expectations. These concepts find common ground in feelings of (lack of) control, but they differ in stability and changeability. We provide some suggestions how these factors can be influenced, and we discuss the meaning of the identified factors for empowering interactions between professionals and their clients. Health professionals can facilitate people to see a correspondence between their efforts and the outcomes thereof, improve and facilitate health literacy, in a relationship which can be characterised as partnership.},

  abstract = {We examined the association between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and adiposity in a nationally representative sample of the UK adult population. We studied 6,143 participants (19 to 96 years, 51.6\% female) sampled by the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008–16). Food items reported in four-day food diary were classified according to the NOVA system. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations between the dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods (sex-specific quartile and continuous) and Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC) and obesity (BMI{$>$}30kg/m2) and abdominal obesity (men: WC≥102cm, women: WC≥88cm) status. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. In multivariable analyses, the highest consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with 1.66 kg/m2 higher BMI (95\%CI 0.96–2.36), 3.56 cm greater WC (95\%CI 1.79–5.33) and 90\% higher odds for being obese (OR = 1.90, 95\%CI 1.39–2.61), compared with the lowest consumption. A 10\% increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with an increase of 0.38 kg/m2 in BMI (95\%CI 0.20–0.55), 0.87 cm in WC (95\%CI 0.40–1.33) and 18\% higher odds of being obese (OR = 1.18, 95\%CI 1.08–1.28). The consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with an increase in BMI, WC and prevalence of obesity in both sexes. A dose response relationship was observed in both sexes, with a 10\% increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods being associated with a 18\% increase in the prevalence of obesity in men and a 17\% increase in women. Higher consumption of ultra-processed food is associated with greater adiposity in the UK adult population. Policy makers should consider actions that promote consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods and reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods.},

  abstract = {Objectives To describe dietary sources of free sugars in different age groups of the UK population considering food groups classified according to the NOVA system and to estimate the proportion of excessive free sugars that could potentially be avoided by reducing consumption of their main sources. Design and setting Cross-sectional data from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008–2014) were analysed. Food items collected using a 4-day food diary were classified according to the NOVA system. Participants 9364 individuals aged 1.5 years and above. Main outcome measures Average dietary content of free sugars and proportion of individuals consuming more than 10\% of total energy from free sugars. Data analysis Poisson regression was used to estimate the associations between each of the NOVA food group and intake of free sugars. We estimated the per cent reduction in prevalence of excessive free sugar intake from eliminating ultra-processed foods and table sugar. Analyses were stratified by age group and adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, survey year, region and equivalised household income (sterling pounds). Results Ultra-processed foods account for 56.8\% of total energy intake and 64.7\% of total free sugars in the UK diet. Free sugars represent 12.4\% of total energy intake, and 61.3\% of the sample exceeded the recommended limit of 10\% energy from free sugars. This percentage was higher among children (74.9\%) and adolescents (82.9\%). Prevalence of excessive free sugar intake increased linearly across quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption for all age groups, except among the elderly. Eliminating ultra-processed foods could potentially reduce the prevalence of excessive free sugar intake by 47\%. Conclusion Our findings suggest that actions to reduce the ultra-processed food consumption generally rich in free sugars could lead to substantial public health benefits.},

Design: Longitudinal study in which food consumption was evaluated according to the percentage contribution of daily energetic intake (\%/d) of each NOVA classification group (unprocessed/minimally processed foods and culinary preparations (U/MPF \& CP); processed foods and ultra-processed foods (UPF)). Hypertension was defined according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) criteria. Adjusted relative risks (RR) and their 95\% confidence intervals (95 \% CI) were estimated by Poisson regression models with robust variances. Setting: Brazil. Participants: 1221 graduates classified as non-hypertensive at baseline and monitored for 2 years. Results: Daily energetic percentage from each group according to degree of processing was 64 center dot 3 (sd 12) \% for U/MPF \& CP; 9 center dot 9 (sd 5 center dot 8) \% for processed foods and 25 center dot 8 (sd 11) \% for UPF.

After adjusting for potential confounders, participants in the upper quintile of daily energetic intake of U/MPF\&CP presented a reduced risk of hypertension (RR: 0 center dot 72; 95 \% CI 0 center dot 52, 0 center dot 98), while those in the upper quintile of daily energetic intake of UPF presented an increased risk of the outcome (RR: 1 center dot 35; 95 \% CI 1 center dot 01, 1 center dot 81). Conclusions: In this prospective cohort of Brazilian middle-aged adult university graduates, the highest consumptions of U/MPF\&CP and UPF were associated with, respectively, reduced and increased risk of hypertension. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our results.},

Current research is primarily based on non-US study populations. The purpose of our study was to estimate the association between UPF consumption and risk of incident hypertension in a population of middle-aged black and white men and women. Methods: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants who were hypertension free at baseline and had complete dietary, covariate, and hypertension data from visit 1 (1987 - 1989) were included (n = 8,866). Participants were followed through November 30, 2019 for the development of hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure [greater than or equal] 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure [greater than or equal] 90 mmHg, or recent patient-reported use of blood pressure lowering medication. Processing level was determined using the NOVA classification system. Data were analyzed using three progressively adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: 6,960 participants developed hypertension during a median follow-up of 13 years. Participants in the highest quartile of UPF consumption were 9\% more likely to develop incident hypertension than those in the lowest quartile (model 2 HR: 1.09; CI: 1.02-1.16; P for trend = 0.01) (Table). Participants who were in the highest quartile of sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meat consumption had a 20\% higher risk of hypertension (model 2 HR, 1.20; CI, 1.12 - 1.28; P for trend {$<$}0.001) and 9\% higher risk of hypertension (model 2 HR, 1.09; CI, 1.02 - 1.17; P for trend {$<$}0.001), respectively, when compared to the lowest quartile. Participants in the highest quartile of minimally or unprocessed food consumption had 9\% lower incidence of hypertension (model 2 HR, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.85 - 0.97; P for trend 0.01). Conclusions: High UPF consumption, specifically sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meat, was associated with higher risk of hypertension, whereas minimally or unprocessed food consumption was associated with lower hypertension risk.},

Nutri-Score is a front-of-pack labelling system adopted by several European countries. This system ranks foods according to their nutritional quality, but does not consider other dimensions such as the degree of food processing. The aim of this study is to compare the nutritional quality (as assessed by Nutri-Score) and the ultra-processing (as assessed by the NOVA classification) of foods in the Open Food Facts database. A simple correspondence analysis was carried out to study the relationship between the two systems. Ultra-processed foods (NOVA 4) were found in all Nutri-Score categories, ranging from 26.08\% in nutritional category A, 51.48\% in category B, 59.09\% in category C, 67.39\% in category D to up to 83.69\% in nutritional category E. Given the negative effect that the consumption of ultra-processed foods has on different aspects of health, front-of-pack labelling with Nutri-Score should at least be accompanied by complementary labelling indicating the level of processing, such as the NOVA classification.},

METHOD: Two independent evaluators analyzed the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science and Lilacs until December 2018. We used the following terms: (convenience foods OR food processing OR highly-processed OR industrialized foods OR minimally-processed OR prepared foods OR processed foods OR ultra-processed OR ultraprocessed OR ultra processed OR unprocessed) AND (metabolic syndrome OR hypertension OR blood pressure OR diabetes mellitus OR glucose OR glycaemia OR insulin OR cholesterol OR triglycerides OR blood lipids OR overweight OR obesity) AND (adult OR adults OR adulthood OR aged OR elderly OR old). We assessed methodological and evidence qualities, and also extracted information for the qualitative synthesis from the selected studies. RESULTS: Of the 6,423 studies identified after removing duplicates, eleven met the eligibility criteria. The main food classification we used was Nova. The consumption of ultra-processed foods was positively associated with overweight and obesity, high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome. All articles included met more than 50\% of the methodological quality criteria. The quality of evidence was considered moderate for the outcome overweight and obesity and weak for hypertension and metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The Nova food classification stands out in the area of nutritional epidemiology when assessing the effects of food processing on health outcomes. Although caution is required in the interpretation, the results indicated that the consumption of ultra-processed foods can have an unfavorable impact in the health of individuals.},

Design: Longitudinal analysis of the ELSA-Brasil with non-hypertensive individuals at baseline. We applied the FFQ at the baseline and categorised energy intake by degree of processing, using the NOVA classification. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured at baseline (2008-2010) and again at first follow-up (2012-2014). Incidence of arterial hypertension was defined as SBP ¿= 140 mmHg or DBP ¿= 90 mmHg or antihypertensive medication during the previous 2 weeks. A mixed-effect linear regression model and mixed-effect logistic regression model were used to estimate associations between UPF consumption and, respectively, changes in blood pressure and incidence of hypertension. Setting: Brazil. Participants: Civil servants of Brazilian public academic institutions in six cities (n 8754), aged 35-74 years at baseline (2008-2010). Results: UPF consumption contributed 25 center dot 2 \% (sd = 9 center dot 6) of total energies consumed. After adjustment, participants with high UPF consumption presented a 23 \% greater risk of developing hypertension (OR = 1 center dot 23, 95 \% CI 1 center dot 06, 1 center dot 44) than those with low UPF consumption. We did not find association between UPF consumption and changes in blood pressure over time. Conclusions: The higher the UPF consumption, the higher the risk of hypertension in adults. Reducing UPF consumption is thus important to promote health and prevent hypertension.},

  abstract = {Objective:To estimate changes in blood pressure and the incidence of hypertension associated with consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) by Brazilian civil servants at a 4-year follow-up.Design:Longitudinal analysis of the ELSA-Brasil with non-hypertensive individuals at baseline. We applied the FFQ at the baseline and categorised energy intake by degree of processing, using the NOVA classification. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured at baseline (2008–2010) and again at first follow-up (2012–2014). Incidence of arterial hypertension was defined as SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg or antihypertensive medication during the previous 2 weeks. A mixed-effect linear regression model and mixed-effect logistic regression model were used to estimate associations between UPF consumption and, respectively, changes in blood pressure and incidence of hypertension.Setting:Brazil.Participants:Civil servants of Brazilian public academic institutions in six cities (n 8754), aged 35–74 years at baseline (2008–2010).Results:UPF consumption contributed 25·2 \% (sd = 9·6) of total energies consumed. After adjustment, participants with high UPF consumption presented a 23 \% greater risk of developing hypertension (OR = 1·23, 95 \% CI 1·06, 1·44) than those with low UPF consumption. We did not find association between UPF consumption and changes in blood pressure over time.Conclusions:The higher the UPF consumption, the higher the risk of hypertension in adults. Reducing UPF consumption is thus important to promote health and prevent hypertension.},

However, little is known about the association between UPF consumption and blood pressure (BP). Thus, this study examined the association between UPF consumption and elevated BP in Korean adults. METHODS: This study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016-2018) and included 9,188 participants aged 30-79 years without a history of hypertension diagnosis. Food items reported in a one-day 24-hour recall were categorized on the basis of the NOVA (not an acronym) food classification criteria. UPF consumption was estimated as the contribution to total energy intake. Elevated BP was defined as systolic BP ≥120 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg. The independent association between UPF consumption and elevated BP was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The upper tertile of UPF consumption was significantly associated with elevated BP compared with the lower tertile, after adjusting for potential confounders. A linear trend was observed for elevated BP across the tertiles of the dietary energy contribution of UPF. Similar results were found in stratified analyses by age group, smoking, obesity, and overall dietary quality. However, a marginal level of association was found in some subgroups, current smokers, and non-obese adults. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary energy contribution of UPF consumption was positively associated with increased prevalence of elevated BP, and these findings suggest that lowering UPF consumption might help prevent BP elevation.},

  abstract = {Consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF) replaces the intake of freshly prepared unprocessed/minimally processed food (MPF) and is positively associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective of this observational study was to investigate the relation between (1) UPF and (2) MPF with peripheral and central blood pressure (BP), wave reflection, and arterial stiffness. Habitual dietary intake, ambulatory BP, augmentation index (AIx), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed in 40 normotensive young adults (15 M/25 W; 27 +/- 1 y; body mass index 23.6 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2)). UPF consumption was positively associated with overall and daytime peripheral systolic BP (B = 0.25, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.03, 0.46, p = 0.029; B = 0.32, 95\% CI 0.09, 0.56, p = 0.008, respectively), daytime diastolic BP (B = 0.18, 95\% CI 0.01, 0.36, p = 0.049) and daytime peripheral pulse pressure (PP; B = 0.22, 95\% CI 0.03, 0.41, p = 0.027). MPF consumption was inversely associated with daytime peripheral PP (B = -0.27, 95\% CI -0.47, -0.07, p = 0.011), overall and daytime central systolic BP (B = -0.27, 95\% CI -0.51, -0.02, p = 0.035; B = -0.31, 95\% CI -0.58, -0.04, p = 0.024, respectively), and nighttime central PP (B = -0.10, 95\% CI -0.19, -0.01, p = 0.042). Both UPF and MPF were not associated with AIx nor PWV. These data suggest avoidance of UPF and consumption of more MPF may reduce CVD risk factors.},

  abstract = {Differing hypertension prevalence rates between certain population and age groups are partially due to differences in the intake of certain nutrients. Blood pressure is positively associated with higher sodium, alcohol, and protein intakes; it is inversely associated with potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes. Salt may lead to an increase in blood pressure in the presence of salt sensitivity, but there is no inexpensive or easy strategy to identify salt-sensitive patients. Other risk factors for hypertension include obesity and lack of regular physical activity. The best strategy appears to be moderate salt restriction (6–7 g/day) in combination with an optimal compliance of the antihypertensive drug therapy, as well as adoption of the combination diet of the DASH study—a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and thus rich in potassium. Current evidence does not support the increased intake of Ca2+ or Mg2+ for blood-pressure-lowering purposes only; however, calcium and magnesium may represent important components in the combination diet of the DASH study. It seems that it is the combination of these nutrients that is of crucial importance for the achievement of optimal blood-pressure reduction. Also recommended is a decrease in alcohol consumption and an increase in regular physical activity. Instead of a severe intervention with regard to 1 risk factor alone, positive changes in 5 habits combined—high salt intake, high sodium-to-potassium ratio, alcohol intake, calorie imbalance, and a sedentary life—may be the most realistic and effective strategy to counteract the present hypertension epidemic.},

Setting: Adolescents assisted by the Family Doctor Program (FDP) in Niteroi, a metropolitan area in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Subjects: Survey of 210 adolescents. Individuals with three or more of the following components of MetS were classified as having this syndrome: TAG ¿= 110 mg/dl; HDL cholesterol ¡ 50 mg/dl for girls aged 12-19 years and boys aged 12-14 years or ¡45 mg/dl for boys aged 15-19 years; waist circumference ¿= 75th percentile; serum glucose ¿100 mg/dl; and blood pressure a ¿= 90th percentile. A semi-quantitative FFQ was used, and foods were grouped as: unprocessed or minimally processed foods (Group 1), processed culinary and food industry ingredients (Group 2) and ultra-processed foods (Group 3). The associations between food consumption and MetS were adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioural and family history covariates and were estimated using generalized estimation equations with the Poisson regression model. Results: MetS was diagnosed in 6.7\% of the adolescents; the most frequent diagnostic criteria included the reduction of HDL cholesterol (46.7\%) elevated serum glucose (17.1\%) and the elevation of waist circumference (16.7\%). Crude analysis showed higher average daily intakes of energy, carbohydrates and ultra-processed foods among adolescents with MetS. After statistical adjustment, the intake of ultra-processed foods (¿= 3rd quartile) remained associated with MetS (prevalence ratio = 2.5; P = 0.012). Conclusions: High consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with the prevalence of MetS in this adolescents group.},

It was aimed to investigate the possible associations of dietary patterns (DPs) with SAD in adults having multiple CVD risk factors. Design: Dietary intake was evaluated through two 24-h dietary recalls and principal component analysis was used to identify DPs. Oscillometry, applanation tonometry with pulse wave analysis and carotid ultrasound were used to assess peripheral and aortic BP, arterial stiffness and pressure wave reflections. Setting: Laiko University Hospital, Athens, Greece. Participants: A total of 470 individuals (53 center dot 1 +/- 14 center dot 2 years) with CVD risk factors were enrolled. Results: A pattern characterised by increased consumption of whole-grain cereals, white meat and reduced consumption of sugar was positively associated with common carotid compliance (beta = 0 center dot 01, 95 \% CI 0 center dot 00, 0 center dot 01), whereas a pattern high in refined cereals, red and processed meat was positively associated with brachial but not aortic systolic pressure (beta = 1 center dot 76, 95 \% CI 0 center dot 11, 3 center dot 42) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (beta = 1 center dot 18, 95 \% CI 0 center dot 02, -2 center dot 38). Low consumption of low-fat dairy products, high consumption of full-fat cheese and butter was positively associated with MAP (beta = 0 center dot 97, 95 \% CI 0 center dot 01, 1 center dot 95). Increased consumption of vegetables, fruits, fresh juices, fish and seafood was inversely associated with augmentation index (AIx) (beta = -1 center dot 01, 95 \% CI -1 center dot 93, -0 center dot 09). Conclusion: Consumption of whole grains, white meat, fruits/vegetables, fish/seafood and avoidance of sugar was associated with improved SAD. Preference in refined grains, red/processed meat, high-fat cheese/butter and low intake of low-fat dairy products were associated with BP elevation.

We analyzed a national survey with 4219 participants. Dietary information was obtained with a 24-h recall. Foods and beverages were classified according to level of processing. The mean intake (mg/d) of Na was 1512 in preschool children, 2844 in school-age children, 3743 in adolescents, and 3132 in adults. The mean intake (mg/d) of K was 1616 in preschool children, 2256 in school-age children, 2967 in adolescents, and 3401 in adults. Processed and ultra-processed foods (UPF) contribute 49\% of Na intake in preschool children, 50\% in school-age children, 47\% in adolescents, and 39\% in adults. Adults with high Na intake had lower serum concentrations of cholesterol, HDL-c, and LDL-c. A significant proportion of the Mexican population has a high intake of Na (64-82\%) and low K (58-73\%). Strategies to reduce Na and increase K intake need to reduce the possibility of having high BP and serum lipid disturbances.},

  abstract = {Ultra-processed foods (UPF) consumption has increased greatly over the last decades but its impact on health remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the prospective effect of different degrees of food processing on children's cardiometabolic profile. Children from the Portuguese population-based birth cohort Generation XXI evaluated at 7 and 10 years of age (y), with dietary information at 7 y and anthropometric measurements at 10 y, were included in the present study (n = 3034). Dietary data were collected by 3-day food diaries and all reported food items were classified according to the degree of processing using the NOVA classification system. The daily consumption of the NOVA classification groups was calculated (in grams, as a proportion of total grams and total energy intake). The cardiometabolic outcomes included were serum markers [fasting glucose, insulin, blood lipids], anthropometric measurements [body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC)], body composition [fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM)] and blood pressure (BP). Age- and sex-specific sample z-scores were obtained for all outcomes. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify a potential cluster of cardiovascular risk factors. Generalized linear models were fitted to evaluate the association between the consumption according to the processing degree (as absolute gram intake) and the individual cardiometabolic risk factors and cluster, adjusted for child's sex, maternal age and education and remaining NOVA groups. A mediation role of children's BMI in the previous analysis were tested. At 7 y, the daily median consumption of un/minimally processed, processed and UPF was 1210 g, 113 g and 433 g (68\%, 6\% and 25\% of the total grams, as well as 51\%, 15\% and 31\% of the total energy intake, respectively). After adjustment, an increase of 100 g in the consumption of un/minimally processed at 7 y was associated with a lower BMI (βˆ = −0.028; 95\%CI: −0.043; −0.014), WC (βˆ = −0.020; 95\%CI: −0.032; −0.008), FM (βˆ = −0.023; 95\%CI: −0.035; −0.011), insulin (βˆ = −0.022; 95\%CI: −0.036; −0.008) and BP (systolic BP: βˆ = −0.014; 95\%CI: −0.025;-0.004; diastolic BP: βˆ = −0.013; 95\%CI: −0.020;-0.005), at 10 y. BMI was a mediator between the consumption of un/minimally processed foods and BP. Positive associations were found between consumption of processed foods and the cluster ‘higher blood pressure’, while an inverse association was described between un/minimally processed and the cluster 'higher blood pressure'. No significant associations were found between the UPF consumption and any cardiometabolic outcomes. High consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods has a favourable effect on later children's cardiometabolic health, namely lower body weight and body fat, lower waist circumference, blood pressure insulin serum levels.},

  abstract = {The eruption of genetic research presents a tremendous opportunity to epidemiologists to improve our ability to identify causes of ill health. Epidemiologists have enthusiastically embraced the new tools of genomics and proteomics to investigate gene-environment interactions. We argue that neither the full import nor limitations of such studies can be appreciated without clarifying underlying theoretical models of interaction, etiologic fraction, and the fundamental concept of causality. We therefore explore different models of causality in the epidemiology of disease arising out of genes, environments, and the interplay between environments and genes. We begin from Rothman's "pie" model of necessary and sufficient causes, and then discuss newer approaches, which provide additional insights into multifactorial causal processes. These include directed acyclic graphs and structural equation models. Caution is urged in the application of two essential and closely related concepts found in many studies: interaction (effect modification) and the etiologic or attributable fraction. We review these concepts and present four important limitations., 1. Interaction is a fundamental characteristic of any causal process involving a series of probabilistic steps, and not a second-order phenomenon identified after first accounting for "main effects"., 2. Standard methods of assessing interaction do not adequately consider the life course, and the temporal dynamics through which an individual's sufficient cause is completed. Different individuals may be at different stages of development along the path to disease, but this is not usually measurable. Thus, for example, acquired susceptibility in children can be an important source of variation., 3. A distinction must be made between individual-based and population-level models. Most epidemiologic discussions of causality fail to make this distinction., 4. At the population level, there is additional uncertainty in quantifying interaction and assigning etiologic fractions to different necessary causes because of ignorance about the components of the sufficient cause.},

  abstract = {Objective To examine the association between consumption of ultra-processed foods and risk of colorectal cancer among men and women from three large prospective cohorts. Design Prospective cohort study with dietary intake assessed every four years using food frequency questionnaires. Setting Three large US cohorts. Participants Men (n= 46 341) from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2014) and women (n=159 907) from the Nurses’ Health Study (1986-2014; n=67 425) and the Nurses’ Health Study II (1991-2015; n=92 482) with valid dietary intake measurement and no cancer diagnosis at baseline. Main outcome measure Association between ultra-processed food consumption and risk of colorectal cancer, estimated using time varying Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors. Results 3216 cases of colorectal cancer (men, n=1294; women, n=1922) were documented during the 24-28 years of follow-up. Compared with those in the lowest fifth of ultra-processed food consumption, men in the highest fifth of consumption had a 29\% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for highest versus lowest fifth 1.29, 95\% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.53; P for trend=0.01), and the positive association was limited to distal colon cancer (72\% increased risk; hazard ratio 1.72, 1.24 to 2.37; P for trend{$<$}0.001). These associations remained significant after further adjustment for body mass index or indicators of nutritional quality of the diet (that is, western dietary pattern or dietary quality score). No association was observed between overall ultra-processed food consumption and risk of colorectal cancer among women. Among subgroups of ultra-processed foods, higher consumption of meat/poultry/seafood based ready-to-eat products (hazard ratio for highest versus lowest fifth 1.44, 1.20 to 1.73; P for trend{$<$}0.001) and sugar sweetened beverages (1.21, 1.01 to 1.44; P for trend=0.013) among men and ready-to-eat/heat mixed dishes among women (1.17, 1.01 to 1.36; P for trend=0.02) was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer; yogurt and dairy based desserts were negatively associated with the risk of colorectal cancer among women (hazard ratio 0.83, 0.71 to 0.97; P for trend=0.002). Conclusions In the three large prospective cohorts, high consumption of total ultra-processed foods in men and certain subgroups of ultra-processed foods in men and women was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Further studies are needed to better understand the potential attributes of ultra-processed foods that contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The childhood obesity rate has been steadily rising among US youths during the past 2 decades. Increasing evidence links consumption of ultraprocessed foods to excessive calorie consumption and weight gain, but trends in the consumption of ultraprocessed foods among US youths have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To characterize trends in the consumption of ultraprocessed foods among US youths. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Serial cross-sectional analysis using 24-hour dietary recall data from a nationally representative sample of US youths aged 2-19 years (n\,=\,33\,795) from 10 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999-2000 to 2017-2018. EXPOSURES: Secular time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of total energy consumed from ultraprocessed foods as defined by NOVA, an established food classification system that categorizes food according to the degree of food processing. RESULTS: Dietary intake from youths were analyzed (weighted mean age, 10.7 years; 49.1\% were girls). From 1999 to 2018, the estimated percentage of total energy from consumption of ultraprocessed foods increased from 61.4\% to 67.0\% (difference, 5.6\% [95\% CI, 3.5\% to 7.7\%]; P\,{$<$}\,.001 for trend), whereas the percentage of total energy from consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods decreased from 28.8\% to 23.5\% (difference, -5.3\% [95\% CI, -7.5\% to -3.2\%]; P\,{$<$}\,.001 for trend). Among the subgroups of ultraprocessed foods, the estimated percentage of energy from consumption of ready-to-heat and -eat mixed dishes increased from 2.2\% to 11.2\% (difference, 8.9\% [95\% CI, 7.7\% to 10.2\%]) and from consumption of sweet snacks and sweets increased from 10.7\% to 12.9\% (difference, 2.3\% [95\% CI, 1.0\% to 3.6\%]), but the estimated percentage of energy decreased for sugar-sweetened beverages from 10.8\% to 5.3\% (difference, -5.5\% [95\% CI, -6.5\% to -4.5\%]) and for processed fats and oils, condiments, and sauces from 7.1\% to 4.0\% (difference, -3.1\% [95\% CI, -3.7\% to -2.6\%]) (all P\,{$<$}\,.05 for trend). There was a significantly larger increase in the estimated percentage of energy from consumption of ultraprocessed foods among non-Hispanic Black youths (from 62.2\% to 72.5\%; difference, 10.3\% [95\% CI, 6.8\% to 13.8\%]) and Mexican American youths (from 55.8\% to 63.5\%; difference, 7.6\% [95\% CI, 4.4\% to 10.9\%]) than the increase among non-Hispanic White youths (from 63.4\% to 68.6\%; difference, 5.2\% [95\% CI, 2.1\% to 8.3\%]) (P\,=\,.04 for trends). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on the NHANES cycles from 1999 to 2018, the estimated proportion of energy intake from consumption of ultraprocessed foods has increased among youths in the US and has consistently comprised the majority of their total energy intake.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Processed foods are major contributors to population dietary salt intake. Parts of the Australian food industry have started to decrease salt in a number of products. A definitive baseline assessment of current sodium concentrations in foods is key to targeting reformulation strategies and monitoring progress. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to systematically collate data on the sodium content of Australian processed food products and compare sodium values against maximum target levels established by the UK Food Standards Agency (UK FSA). DESIGN: Categories of processed foods that contribute the majority of salt to Australian diets were identified. Food-composition data were sought for all products in these categories, and the sodium content in mg/100 g (or mg/100 mL for liquids) was recorded for each. Mean sodium values were calculated for each grouping and compared with the UK FSA benchmarks. RESULTS: Sodium data were collected for 7221 products in 10 food groups, 33 food categories, and 90 food subcategories. The food groups that were highest in sodium were sauces and spreads (1283 mg/100 g) and processed meats (846 mg/100 g). Cereal and cereal products (206 mg/100 g) and fruit and vegetables (211 mg/100 g) were the lowest in sodium. Sixty-three percent of food categories had mean sodium concentrations above the UK FSA targets, and most had wide ranges between the most and least salty product. CONCLUSIONS: Many products, particularly breads, processed meats, and sauces, have salt amounts above reasonable benchmarks. The variation in salt concentrations between comparable products suggests that reformulation is highly feasible for many foods.},

These products constitute a large and increasing amount of the food supply in high and middle‐income countries. Accumulating evidence point to an association of UPF intake with increased mortality and adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, whether UPF consumption is associated with cognitive function is not clear. We investigated the associations between UPF intake and cognitive decline, in a cohort of older adults at high‐risk for dementia due to type‐2 diabetes (T2D). Method The study sample included initially non‐demented T2D older adults (≥65y), from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline (IDCD) study, who had complete information on nutrition at baseline and at least three cognitive assessments (mean follow‐up 5.3±1.5y). Nutritional intake was evaluated by a validated Food‐Frequency Questionnaire and foods were categorized as UPF based on NOVA classification. Percent of calories from UPF were calculated from total caloric consumption, first as overall UPF intake and then for specific food groups. Global cognitive functioning and four cognitive domains (episodic memory, working memory/attention, semantic categorization, and executive functions) were assessed. Mixed effect models were used to examine the link between UPF intake (top vs. bottom quartiles) and change in cognitive function while adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking, physical activity, BMI, HbA1C, duration of diabetes, total cholesterol and blood pressure. Result Of the total sample (N=578; mean age at baseline 71.3±4.5y, 61\% men), 144 (top quartile) consumed ¿31\% kcal from UPF out of total kcal. Total UPF consumption was not related to cognitive function. However, consumption of ultra‐processed fat (e.g. mayonnaise) was associated with faster decline in global cognition, executive function and memory (ß=‐0.028±0.010; p=0.009, ß=‐0.031±0.014; p=0.022 and ß=‐0.035±0.017; p=0.046, respectively). Additionally, increased intake of ultra‐processed meat (e.g. sausages) was associated with a faster decline in executive functions (ß=‐0.029±0.013; p=0.031). UPF derived from dairy products and carbohydrates were not associated with cognitive change. Conclusion This pioneering study suggests a possible association of ultra‐processed meat and fat intake with accelerated cognitive decline in older individuals with T2D, independently of sociodemographic, lifestyle, cardiovascular and T2D‐related factors.},

  abstract = {Background/objectives Little is known about time trends in diet quality and associated inequalities in the UK. This study aimed to examine trends in adherence to four UK dietary recommendations, overall and among sociodemographic subgroups, from 1986 to 2012. Subjects/methods We conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis using data from three UK diet surveys: Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults 1986–87 (n = 2018), National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) 2000–01 (n = 1683) and NDNS Rolling Programme 2008–12 (n = 1632). We measured adherence to dietary recommendations for fruit and vegetables, salt, oily fish, and red and processed meat, estimated using food diary record data. We compared adherence across surveys and by four sociodemographic characteristics: sex, age, socioeconomic position and ethnicity. Results Overall, population adherence to dietary recommendations was low to moderate, but improved over time. There were inequalities in adherence to all recommendations at all timepoints according to one or more sociodemographic characteristic. When inequalities were present, women, older adults, those with non-manual occupations and non-Whites were more likely to adhere to dietary recommendations. Although some dietary inequalities declined, most persisted across the three surveys. Conclusions The persistence of most inequalities highlights the need for further interventions to reduce dietary inequalities as well as improve overall population diet. The greatest simultaneous improvement in population adherence and reduction of inequalities was observed for salt, which may reflect the success of the UK Salt Reduction Programme. Similarly comprehensive programmes should be encouraged for other dietary components.},
